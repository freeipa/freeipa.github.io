Config_Files
============



Configuration files
-------------------

The server and client share a common core configuration file,
``/etc/ipa/default.conf``. This file is read by the server at startup
and the ``ipa`` command every time it is executed.

The section ``[global]`` is mandatory and the only section used. A
sample default configuration file is:

::

    [global]
    basedn=dc=example,dc=com
    realm=EXAMPLE.COM
    domain=example.com
    xmlrpc_uri=``\ ```https://ipa.example.com/ipa/xml`` <https://ipa.example.com/ipa/xml>`__
    ldap_uri=ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fslapd-EXAMPLE-COM.socket
    enable_ra=True

These values are shared between the client and server (on the same
machine). If you need to make client or server-specific configuration
changes you can create a configuration file for it. For the server used
``/etc/ipa/server.conf`` and for client configuration used
``/etc/ipa/cli.conf``

For example, if you want to enable debug logging for the server only,
create ``/etc/ipa/server.conf`` containing:

::

    [global]
    debug=True

To always have verbose mode set on the client, create
``/etc/ipa/cli.conf`` that contains:

::

    [global]
    verbose=True

Merging
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The order that file configuration files are read is:

#. context file (``/etc/ipa/server.conf`` or ``/etc/ipa/cli.conf``)
#. default file (``/etc/ipa/default.conf``)

Once an attribute is set it is not overridden if it appears in another
configuration file.

For example, if you set ``debug=True`` in ``server.conf`` and
``debug=False`` in ``default.conf`` then it will be ``True`` because the
value in ``default.conf`` will be ignored.
