Highlights in 4.8.7
-------------------

-  3687: [RFE] IPA user account expiry warning.

      EPN stands for Expiring Password Notification. It is a standalone
      tool designed to build a list of users whose password would expire
      in the near future, and either display the list in a
      machine-readable (JSON) format, or send email notifications to
      these users. EPN provides command-line options to display the list
      of affected users. This provides data introspection and helps
      understand how many emails would be sent for a given day, or a
      given date range. The command-line options can also be used by a
      monitoring system to alert whenever a number of emails over the
      SMTP quota would be sent. EPN is meant to be launched once a day
      from an IPA client (preferred) or replica from a systemd timer.
      EPN does not keep state: the list of affected users is built at
      runtime but never kept.

--------------

-  3827: [RFE] Expose TTL in web UI

      DNS record time to live (TTL) parameters can be edited in Web UI

--------------

-  6783: [RFE] Host-group names command rename

      host groups can now be renamed with IPA CLI: 'ipa hostgroup-mod
      group-name --rename new-name'. Protected hostgroups ('ipaservers')
      cannot be renamed.

--------------

-  7577: [RFE] DNS package check should be called earlier in
   installation routine

      The \``--setup-dns`\` knob and interactive installer now both
      check for the presence of freeipa-server-dns early and abort the
      installer with an error before starting actual deployment.

--------------

-  7695: ipa service-del should display principal name instead of
   Invalid 'principal'.

      When deleting services, report exact name of a system required
      principal that couldn't be deleted.

--------------

-  8106: ca-certificate file not being parsed correctly on Ubuntu with
   p11-kit-trust.so due to data inserted by FreeIPA Client install

      On Debian-based platforms update-ca-certificates does not support
      multiple certificates in a single file. IPA installers now write
      individual files per each certificate for Debian-based platforms.

--------------

-  8217: RFE: ipa-backup should compare locally and globally installed
   server roles

      ipa-backup now checks whether the local replica's roles match
      those used in the cluster and exits with a warning if this is not
      the case as backups taken on this host would not be sufficient for
      a proper restore. FreeIPA administrators are advised to double
      check whether the host backups are run has all the necessary
      (used) roles.

--------------

-  8222: Upgrade dojo.js

      Version of dojo.js framework used by FreeIPA Web UI was upgraded
      to 1.16.2.

--------------

-  8268: Prevent use of too long passwords

      Kerberos tools limit password entered in kpasswd or kadmin tools
      to 1024 characters but do not allow to distinguish between
      passwords cut off at 1024 characters and passwords with 1024
      characters. Thus, a limit of 1000 characters is now applied
      everywhere in FreeIPA.

--------------

-  8276: Add default password policy for sysaccounts

      cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc now has a default password policy to permit
      system accounts with krbPrincipalAux object class. This allows
      system accounts to have a keytab that does not expire. The
      "Default System Accounts Password Policy" has a minimum password
      length in case the password is directly modified with LDAP.

--------------

-  8284: Upgrade jQuery version to actual one

      Version of jQuery framework used by FreeIPA Web UI was updated to
      3.4.1.

--------------

-  8289: ipa servicedelegationtarget-add-member does not allow to add
   hosts as targets

      service delegation rules and targets now allow to specify hosts as
      a rule or a target's member principal.

--------------

-  8291: krb5kdc crashes in IPA plugin on use of IPA Windows principal
   alias

      Memory handling in various FreeIPA KDC functions was improved,
      preventing potential crashes when looking up machine account
      aliases for Windows machines.

--------------

-  8301: The value of the first character in target\* keywords is
   expected to be a double quote

      389-ds 1.4 enforces syntax for target\* keywords (targetattr,
      targetfilter, etc) to have quoted attributes. Otherwise the aci
      that contains unquoted parameters is ignored. Default FreeIPA
      access controls were fixed to follow 389-ds syntax. Any
      third-party ACIs need to be updated manually.

--------------

-  8315: [dirsrv] set 'nsslapd-enable-upgrade-hash: off' as this raises
   warnings

      389-ds 1.4.1.6 introduced automatic password hash upgrade on LDAP
      binds. FreeIPA now disables this feature because changing password
      hash in FreeIPA is not allowed by the internal plugins that
      synchronize password hashes between LDAP and Kerberos.

--------------

-  8322: [RFE] Changing default hostgroup is too easy

      In Web UI a confirmation dialog was added to automember
      configuration to prevent unintended modification of a default host
      group.

--------------

-  8325: [WebUI] Fix htmlPrefilter issue in jQuery

      CVE-2020-11022: In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2
      and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after
      sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e.
      .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.
      FreeIPA is not allowing to pass arbitrary code into affected
      jQuery path but we applied jQuery fix anyway.

--------------

-  8335: [WebUI] manage IPA resources as a user from a trusted Active
   Directory domain

      When users from trusted Active Directory domains have permissions
      to manage IPA resources, they can do so through a Web UI
      management console.

--------------

-  8348: Allow managed permissions with ldap:///self bind rule

      Managed permissions can now address self-service operations. This
      makes possible for 3rd-party plugins to supply full set of managed
      permissions.

--------------

-  8357: Allow managing IPA resources as a user from a trusted Active
   Directory forest

      A 3rd-party plugin to provide management of IPA resources as users
      from trusted Active Directory domains was merged into FreeIPA
      core. ID user overrides can now be added to IPA management groups
      and roles and thus allow AD users to manage IPA.

--------------

-  8362: IPA: Ldap authentication failure due to Kerberos principal
   expiration UTC timestamp

      LDAP authentication now handles Kerberos principal and password
      expiration time in UTC time zone. Previously, a local server time
      zone was applied even though UTC was implied in the settings.
