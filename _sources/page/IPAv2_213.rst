IPAv2_213
=========

\__NOTOC_\_ October 19, 2011

The FreeIPA project team is pleased to announce the availability of the
freeIPA 2.1.3 server.

It is available in Fedora 15, 16 and rawhide.



What happened to 2.1.2!?
------------------------

Right after tagging 2.1.2 we found an upgrade issue that would have
affected any users using the selfsign CA (installed with --selfsign). We
decided to hold back the release, fix a few more bugs, and just push out
2.1.3 instead about a week later. So here we are.



Highlights in 2.1.3
-------------------

-  Enforce that system hostname matches hostname of IPA server.
-  Require that /etc/hosts is sane even when configuring DNS.
-  Increase default server-side LDAP search limits.
-  Client enrollment improvements including longer wait for sssd to
   start, recovery if discovered IPA server is not responsive and when
   anonymous bind is disabled in 389-ds.



Highlights in 2.1.2
-------------------

-  Upgrade older dogtag installs to use new PKI proxy configuration
-  hbactest improvements
-  Added platform-independent code to make ipa-client-install more
   portable
-  Make client uninstaller more robust, should restore state more
   completely.
-  UI usability improvements
-  Tool for Enabling/Disabling Managed Entry Plugins
-  Managed Entries configuration is now replicated
-  IPv6 client enrollment improvements
-  Man page improvements
-  Performance improvements when calculating indirect membership
-  Improved handling of disabled anonymous binds in 389-ds
-  user is now prompted to enter current password when changing to a new

password

-  ipa server now support multiple namingContexts. ipa-client-install
   and

password migration were fixed

Upgrading
---------

Server
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To upgrade a 2.0.0, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0 server do the following:

``# yum update freeipa-server --enablerepo=updates-testing``

This will pull in updated freeIPA, 389-ds, dogtag, libcurl and xmlrpc-c
packages (and perhaps some others). A script will be executed in the rpm
postinstall phase to update the IPA LDAP server with any required
changes.

There is a bug reported against 389-ds,
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=730387, related to
read-write locks. The NSPR RW lock implementation does not safely allow
re-entrant use of reader locks. This is a timing issue so it is
difficult to predict. During testing one user experienced this and the
upgrade hung. To break the hang kill the ns-slapd process for your
realm, wait for the yum transaction to complete, then restart 389-ds and
manually run the update process:

::

    # service dirsrv start
    # ipa-ldap-updater --update

Client
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ipa-client-install tool in the ipa-client package is just a
configuration tool. There should be no need to re-run this on every
client already enrolled.
