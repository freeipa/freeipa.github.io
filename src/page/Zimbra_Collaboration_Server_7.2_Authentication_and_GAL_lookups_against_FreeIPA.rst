**HOWTO: Zimbra Collaboration Server 7.2 - Authentication and GAL
lookups against FreeIPA.**

**Provided by Dale Macartney**

This document is written as an integration document to configure IPA as
an Authentication Source as well as a Directory source for an already
existing Zimbra installation.

This document is not intended as a walkthrough on how to install and
configure Zimbra Collaboration Server.

This document was written and tested using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2
x86_64 running Zimbra Collaboration Server 7.2 (Network Edition)

For the purpose of this document, the following information is given

Servers:

| ``IPA Server = ds01.example.com``
| ``Zimbra Server = zimbra03.example.com``

**``IMPORTANT``**

Please note, that by adding FreeIPA as the external authentication
backend, the username "admin" will clash as both IPA and Zimbra use an
admin account.

you MUST set the following so that, should LDAP authentication fail for
what ever reason, you will be able to still login with the local admin
account.

If you do not do this and you lose LDAP authentication, you will not be
able to log in as the Zimbra Admin user.

| ``[root@zimbra03 ~]# su -l zimbra``
| ``[zimbra@zimbra03 ~]$ zmprov modifydomain example.com zimbraAuthFallbackToLocal TRUE``
| ``[zimbra@zimbra03 ~]$``

Prerequisite:
-------------

We will need to create a bind account for Zimbra to authenticate to IPA
as a service account.

To do this, create an ldif file detailing your service account. I used
the following, saved as zimbra.ldif

| ``dn: uid=zimbra,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=example,dc=com``
| ``changetype: add``
| ``objectclass: account``
| ``objectclass: simplesecurityobject``
| ``uid: zimbra``
| ``userPassword: woofwoofimasecretpasswordthatisreallydifficult``
| ``passwordExpirationTime: 20380119031407Z``
| ``nsIdleTimeout: 0``

Save your file, and then import it on your IPA server

| ``[root@ds01 ~]# ldapmodify -h ds01.example.com -p 389 -x -D "cn=Directory  Manager" -w redhat123 -f zimbra.ldif``
| ``adding new entry "uid=zimbra,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=example,dc=com"``
| ``[root@ds01 ~]#``

Your service account is now imported



Zimbra Authentication with FreeIPA
----------------------------------

Step 1 :

Log into the Zimbra admin console
https://zimbra03.example.com:7071/zimbraAdmin/

See attached screenshot.

Step 2 :

Once logged in as the admin user, on the left select domains, then click
the domain you wish to add authentication to, and click the
Authentication button above it.

See attached screenshot.

Step 3 :

Select "External LDAP"

Enter your IPA server's host name (mine is ds01.example.com)

Under LDAP Filter, enter
"(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%u))"
without the quotes

Under LDAP Search Base, enter "cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com"
without the quotes

Then click Next.

See attached screenshot.

Step 4 :

Place a tick in the box next to "Use DN/Password to bind to external
server:" and enter your service account details.

Note: the correct value to use is as it appears as the output from your
ldapmodify command above.

Click Next

See attached screenshot.

Step 5 :

Here you have the chance to verify your settings to make sure they are
working.

Create a test user and enter the username and password in the fields
available, and then click the test button

See attached screenshot.

Step 6 :

If everything is behaving as it should, you will see a green message,
stating that the authentication process completed suggessfully.

Click next and then finally click finish.

See attached screenshot.

The authentication process is now completed.

See attached screenshot.

Step 6 :

Now verify your work and mail-enable your test user

Inside the admin console, on the left, select accounts, then click new,
account Fill in the relevant details, where the account name matches the
username within IPA

Under the "Password" section, enter the External LDAP Account as it
would appear from an ldapsearch. My testuser appears as follows
uid=testuser,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com

Click Finish once you have filled in all the details you wish to enter.

In a new window, open your browser to http://zimbra03.example.com/ enter
your IPA username and password and login

Once you have logged in, you will see a new empty mailbox with the test
username in the top right corner.

See attached screenshot.

Zimbra Global Address List lookups against FreeIPA
--------------------------------------------------

Step 1 :

In the admin console, on the left select domains, then click the domain
you wish to edit

Click the "Configure GAL" button and enter the following details

Step 2 :

IMPORTANT, the default port for the ldap search seems to be spefic for
Active Directory. Please change the port number to 389

Enter the address of your IPA server under "External Server Name" and
set the port to 389

Under "Search Filter", enter "(\&(\|(cn=\*%s\*)(sn=\*%s\*)))" without the
quotes.

Under "Autocomplete Filter", enter
"(\|(uid=%s\*)(givenname=%s\*)(mail=%s\*))" without the quotes.

Under "LDAP Search base", enter "dc=example,dc=com" without the quotes.

Then click next

See attached screenshot.

Step 3 :

Place a tick in the box where is says "Use DN/Password to bind to
external server"

Use the service account you created earlier as the bind account. Enter
the following "uid=zimbra,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=example,dc=com"
without the quotes

Enter your service account password.

Click Next

See attached screenshot.

Step 4:

By default, there will be a tick alongside "Use GAL search settings for
GAL sync", leave this as is and click next.

Step 5:

Enter the username or other name for your test user, and click the test
button.

See attached screenshot

Your IPA GAL is now implemented.

You can verify the Global Address list by creating a new email and
clicking the "To:" button which will allow you to search for your
FreeIPA user accounts.
