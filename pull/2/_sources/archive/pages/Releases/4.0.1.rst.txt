Excessive logging by 389-ds-base 1.3.2.20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeIPA 4.0.1 pulls 389-ds-base 1.3.2.20 as a dependency
(`updates-testing
repo <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2014-8709/389-ds-base-1.3.2.20-1.fc20>`__
in Fedora 20). However, this version of the Directory Server produces
following logs for internal write operations:

``[26/Jul/2014:01:28:53 +0200] - Connection is NULL and hence cannot access SLAPI_CONN_ID``

This log is
`benign <http://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-devel/2014-July/msg00388.html>`__,
Directory Server team tracks the problem in ticket
`#47834 <https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/47834>`__.

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

| ``# ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade``
| ``# ipa-upgradeconfig``

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 3.3.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
