The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA 4.8.0 release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Builds
for Fedora 30 will be available in the official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/freeipa/freeipa-4-8/>`__.



Highlights in 4.8.0
-------------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeIPA 4.8.0 is a major release. Below is the list of noticeable
changes between FreeIPA 4.7 and 4.8.0:

-  Removal or deprecation of weak ciphers

Following a general effort to harden FreeIPA deployments, FreeIPA 4.8.0
removes default support for weak ciphers. 3DES and RC4 ciphers are not
accessible for use in Kerberos anymore, and, in addition, Camelia
ciphers are not accessible when FreeIPA is deployed in FIPS mode. The
only permitted ciphers are the AES family (called aes, which is the
combination of: aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96, aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96,
aes256-cts-hmac-sha384-192, and aes128-cts-hmac-sha256-128).

DES, RC4, and Camellia are not permitted in FIPS mode by the underlying
system crypto libraries. While 3DES is permitted, the KDF used for it in
Kerberos V protocol is not, and Microsoft doesn't implement 3DES anyway.

--------------

-  3999: [RFE] Fix and Document how to set up Samba File Server with IPA

FreeIPA 4.8.0 introduces a tool to configure Samba file server on IPA
client. The tool, "ipa-client-samba" performs Samba configuration and
creates all required services on IPA side. Both the client side and the
server side (IPA master) require FreeIPA 4.8.0 due to multiple changes
introduced. Please see `domain
controller <https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa/blob/master/doc/designs/adtrust/samba-domain-controller.md>`__
and `domain
member <https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa/blob/master/doc/designs/adtrust/samba-domain-member.md>`__
design documents for more details.

--------------

-  4440: Add support for bounce_url to /ipa/ui/reset_password.html

The /ipa/ui/reset_password.html page accepts url parameter to provide
the user with a back link after successful password reset, to support
resets initiated by external web applications. Additional parameter
delay automatically redirects back after the specified number of seconds
has elapsed.

--------------

-  4491: Use lib389 to install 389-ds instead of setup-ds.pl

FreeIPA now utilizes Python-based installer of 389-ds directory server

--------------

-  4580: FreeIPA's LDAP server requires SASL security strength factor of
   >= 56

Original FreeIPA 4.7.90.pre1 set FreeIPA LDAP server default
configuration to require SASL security strength factor higher than 56
bit. However, this change caused "realmd" and other enrollment tools to
fail as they expected to be able to retrieve certain information from
FreeIPA LDAP server unauthenticated. The change for the server
configuration was backed off. We intend to revisit this hardnening later
in FreeIPA 4.8 series.

--------------

-  5608: Tech preview: add Dogtag configuration extensions

FreeIPA team started rewrite of the Certificate Authority configuration
to make possible passing additional options when configuring Dogtag.
This is required to allow use of hardware secure (HSM) modules within
FreeIPA CA but also to allow tuning CA defaults. HSM configuration is
not yet fully available due to a number of open issues in Dogtag itself.

--------------

-  5803: Add utility to promote CA replica to CRL master

New utility was added to promote a CA replica to be the CRL master.
`Design
page <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Promotion_to_CRL_generation_master>`__
provides more details and use examples.

--------------

-  6077: Support One-Way Trust authenticated by trust secret

Samba integration was updated to allow establishing trust to Active
Directory from Windows side using a Trust wizard. This allows to
establish a one-way trust authenticated by a shared trust secret.
Additionally, it allows to establish a trust with Samba AD DC 4.7 or
later, initiated from Samba AD DC side.

--------------

-  6790: Allow creating IPA CA with 3084-bit key.

CA key size default is raised to 3072 instead of 2048 because it's the
recommended size by NIST. An extensibility feature added with ticket
5608 allows increasing the CA key size further buta 4096-bit key is
considerably slower. The change only affects new deployments. There is
no way to upgrade existing CA infrastructure other than issuing a new CA
key and re-issuing new certificates to all existing users of the old
root CA. In addition, lightweight sub-CAs are currently hard-coded to
2048 bit key size. All relevant public root CAs in the CA/B forum use
2048-bit RSA keys and SHA-256 PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures.

--------------

-  7193: Warn or adjust umask if it is too restrictive to break
   installation

FreeIPA deployment now enforces own umask settings that are known to
work at install time at hardened sites which follow some of STIG
recommendations.

--------------

-  7200: ipa-pkinit-manage reports a switch from local pkinit to full
   pkinit configuration was successful although it was not

The command ipa-pkinit-manage enable|disable is reporting success even
though the PKINIT cert is not re-issued. The command triggers the
request of a new certificate (signed by IPA CA when state=enable,
selfsigned when disabled), but as the cert file is still present,
certmonger does not create a new request and the existing certificate is
kept.

The fix consists in deleting the cert and key file before calling
certmonger to request a new cert.

--------------

-  7206: Provide an option to include FQDN in IDM topology graph

In the replication topology graph visualization, it is now possible to
see a fully qualified name of the server. This change helps to reduce
confusion when managing complex multi-datacenter topologies.

--------------

-  7365: make kdcproxy errors in httpd error log less annoying in case
   AD KDCs are not reachable

Log level for technical messages of a KDC proxy was reduced to keep logs
clean.

--------------

-  7451: Allow issuing certificates with IP addresses in subjectAltName

FreeIPA now allows issuing certificates with IP addresses in the subject
alternative name (SAN), if all of the following are true:

-  

   -  One of the DNS names in the SAN resolves to the IP address
      (possibly through a CNAME).
   -  All of the DNS entries in the resolution chain are managed by this
      IPA instance.
   -  The IP address has a (correct) reverse DNS entry that is managed
      by this IPA instance

--------------

-  7568: FreeIPA no longer supports Python 2

Removed Python 2 related code and configuration from spec file, autoconf
and CI infrastructure. From now on, FreeIPA 4.8 requires at least Python
3.6. Python 2 packages like python2-ipaserver or python2-ipaclient are
no longer available. PR-CI, lint, and tox aren't testing Python 2
compatibility anymore.

--------------

-  7632: Allow IPA Services to Start After the IPA Backup Has Completed

ipa-backup gathers all the files needed for the backup, then compresses
the file and finally restarts the IPA services. When the backup is a
large file, the compression may take time and widen the unavailabity
window. This fix restarts the services as soon as all the required files
are gathered, and compresses after services are restarted.

--------------

-  7619, 7640, 7641: UI migration, password reset and configuration
   pages support translations

Static pages in FreeIPA web UI now allow translated content

--------------

-  7658: sysadm_r should be included in default SELinux user map order

sysadm_r is a standard SELinux user role included in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux.

--------------

-  7667: Use only TLS 1.2 by default

TLS 1.3 is causing some trouble with client cert authentication.
Conditional client cert authentication requires post-handshake
authentication extension on TLS 1.3. The new feature is not fully
implemented yet. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer state of the art and now
disabled by default. TLS 1.2 works everywhere and supports perfect
forward secrecy mode (PFS).

--------------

-  7689: Domain Level 0 is no longer supported

Code to support operation on Domain Level 0 is removed. In order to
upgrade to FreeIPA 4.8.0 via replication, an existing deployment must
first be brought up to Domain Level 1.

--------------

-  7716: [RFE] remove "last init status" from ipa-replica-manage list if
   it's None.

If a supplier or consumer of LDAP replication data has never done a
total update, its status is not shown anymore in "ipa-replica-manage
list" output

--------------

-  7747: Support interactive prompt for NTP options for FreeIPA

FreeIPA now asks user for NTP source server or pool address in
interactive mode if there is no server nor pool specified and
autodiscovery has not found any NTP source in DNS records.

--------------

-  7892: hidden / unadvertised IPA replica

A hidden replica is an IPA master server that is not advertised to
clients or other masters. Hidden replicas have all services running and
available, but none of the services has any DNS SRV records or enabled
LDAP server roles. This makes hidden replicas invisible for service
discovery. `Design
document <https://pagure.io/freeipa/blob/master/f/doc/designs/hidden-replicas.md>`__
provides more details on use cases and management of hidden replicas.

--------------

-  PyPI packages have fewer dependencies

The official PyPI packages ipalib, ipapython, ipaplatform, and ipaclient
no longer depend on the binary extensions netifaces and python-ldap by
default.
