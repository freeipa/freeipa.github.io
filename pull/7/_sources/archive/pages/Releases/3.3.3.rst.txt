The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v3.3.3!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Fedora
19 and Fedora 20 builds are already on their way to updates-testing
repo.

Highlights in 3.3.3
-------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  New ipa-advise plugins for configuring legacy clients via
   nss-pam-ldapd
-  New ipa-advise plugins for configuring legacy clients via nss_ldap
-  FreeIPA server can now co-exist with mod_ssl serving other non-443
   ports

.. _bug_fixes:

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  ipa-replica-install no longer crashes when being installed with a CA
   support
-  winsync reinitialization no longer prints error
-  Samba configuration added by ipa-adtrust-install is now properly
   removed
-  Administrative password changes (e.g. by Directory Manager) now
   respect maximum password life as defined in password policy
-  nsds5ReplicaStripAttrs is now properly set on replication agreements,
   avoiding potential replication issues
-  ... and numerous other small fixes

.. _test_improvements:

Test improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  New integration test for external CA installation
-  New integration tests for AD Trust legacy clients feature
-  Numerous small fixes in test framework and beaker integration

.. _deprecated_functionality:

Deprecated functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  DNS can no longer be configured with --no-serial-autoincrement
   option. Serial autoincrement is a requirement for several DNS main
   features, including zone transfers and future DNSSEC support
-  LanMan hash is no longer supported or generated. LanMan hash has
   several security weaknesses allowing attacker to crack it in a
   reasonable time. As such, the LanMan hash was already not allowed in
   a default configuration and had to be explicitly enabled.

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

#. ipa-upgradeconfig
#. ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
