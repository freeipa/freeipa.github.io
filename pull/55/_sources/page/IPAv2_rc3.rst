Repositories and Installation
-----------------------------

-  Use the following
   `repository <http://freeipa.org/downloads/freeipa-devel.repo>`__ to
   install the release candidate packages.
-  FreeIPA relies on the latest versions of the packages currently
   available from the updates-testing repository. Please make sure to
   enable this repository before you proceed with installation.



Known Issues
------------

-  Installing IPA on Fedora-15 works but can take more time than Fedora
   14 due to systemd. It is not recognizing some restarts as being
   successful so only continues after a 3-minute timeout. We are working
   on a solution.
