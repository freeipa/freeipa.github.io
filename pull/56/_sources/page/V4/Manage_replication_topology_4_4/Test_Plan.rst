Overview
========

Some new features were introduced in Managed Topology functionality of
IPA with IPA version 4.4.

#. 'ipa-server-install --uninstall' executed on replica now triggers the
   remote 'server_del' API call on master causing removal of RUV's which
   eliminates the necessity to run 'ipa-replica-manage del' on master to
   correctly clean replication agreements.
#. A replica can be now removed on the server with the command 'ipa
   server-del' - it serves as a combination of 'ipa-csreplica-manage
   del' and 'ipa-replica-manage del'
#. ipa-replica-manage list-ruv now lists not only domain-related Replica
   Update Vectors (RUVs), but also ca-specific
#. 'ipa-replica-manage del' now correctly cleans all RUV's even if the
   replica is offline (before that the RUV's were cleaned only if the
   replica could be contacted during the process)
