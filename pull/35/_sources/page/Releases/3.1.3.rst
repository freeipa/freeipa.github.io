The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version FreeIPA v3.1.3.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads.

This release includes backport of selected (mainly Trust related)
features from upcoming FreeIPA 3.2.0 release. The following 3.1.x
releases will contain primarily bugfixes only.



Highlights in 3.1.3
-------------------



New features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  New cert-find command. Search certificates in the Dogtag database
   based on their serial number, validity or revocation details. This
   feature is available both as a CLI command and Web UI page.
-  New trustconfig-show and trustconfig-mod command. Show or modify AD
   Trust settings generated during AD Trust installation
   (ipa-adtrust-install)
-  New realmdomains-show and realmdomains-mod command. Manage list of
   domains managed by FreeIPA server. The list will be used in future
   releases to inform trusted domain about domains managed by FreeIPA.
   This feature is available both as a CLI command and Web UI page.
-  Support trusted domain users in HBAC test command (hbactest command).
-  Allow filtering incoming trusted domain SIDs per-trust (trust-mod
   command).
-  Faster UI loading. FreeIPA Web UI application is now packaged in
   minimalized format. FreeIPA web server is now also able to transmit
   data in compressed format.



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Fixed migration from OpenLDAP. FreeIPA is now able to migrate users
   and groups from OpenLDAP database instances.
-  Migration process is now also a lot faster and provides more debug
   output (to httpd error log).
-  SUDO rules disabled by sudorule-disable command are now removed from
   ou=sudoers compat tree without a need to restart 389 Directory Server
   instance.
-  Fixed LDAP schema upgrade when upgrading from a pre-2.2.0 release
-  Fixed server installation with external CA (--external-ca)
-  Consolidate on-line help system, show help without need of valid
   Kerberos credentials (ipa help)
-  ... and many others stabilization fixes, see Detailed changelog for
   full details

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 is supported. Upgrading from previous versions is
not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
