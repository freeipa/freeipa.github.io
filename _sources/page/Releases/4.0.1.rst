The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v4.0.1!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The
builds are available for Fedora 21 or in an unofficial Fedora 20 `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/pviktori/freeipa/>`__.



Highlights in 4.0.1
-------------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  TOTP watermark support was added. The last token interval is now
   being added to database and replicated in FreeIPA realm. Note that
   the number of writes is kept the same as an unnecessary LDAP write
   was eliminated.
-  Effective Attributes widget in the Add Permission Web UI page was
   improved



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  ipa-client-install is now again able to join older servers (pre-4.0)
-  Password migration in migrate-ds command was fixed by enabling
   nsslapd-allow-hashed-passwords setting by default
-  ipa-client-install no longer crashes during uninstallation when
   chronyd service cannot be started
-  Server installation could hang as no members could be added to
   "cn=adtrust agents" system account
-  Web UI login page now distinguishes between OTP users with invalid
   and expired password and properly shows the Reset password dialog
-  ipa-server-install and ipa-replica-install now better detects when
   PKI was configured and is able to properly uninstall it when
   installation crashed



Known Issues
------------



Excessive logging by 389-ds-base 1.3.2.20
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeIPA 4.0.1 pulls 389-ds-base 1.3.2.20 as a dependency
(`updates-testing
repo <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2014-8709/389-ds-base-1.3.2.20-1.fc20>`__
in Fedora 20). However, this version of the Directory Server produces
following logs for internal write operations:

``[26/Jul/2014:01:28:53 +0200] - Connection is NULL and hence cannot access SLAPI_CONN_ID``

This log is
`benign <http://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-devel/2014-July/msg00388.html>`__,
Directory Server team tracks the problem in ticket
`#47834 <https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/47834>`__.

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

::

    # ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade
    # ipa-upgradeconfig

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 3.3.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
