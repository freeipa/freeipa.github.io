General Queries

Migration Issues
----------------

#:**Q:** I have been running a pilot program with freeIPA with a number
of AD users. Is it possible to "link" these user accounts from freeIPA
to the same people's AD accounts, without deleting and re-creating all
the accounts? How are these accounts matched?

#:**A:** Yes, this is possible. The user entries coming from AD are
matched by name with the existing entries in IPA, and will "take over"
control of those entries. There is no need to delete and re-create them.
