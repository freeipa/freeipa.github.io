The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v3.2.0.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The new
version has also been built for Fedora 19 and is on its way to
updates-testing.

Many thanks to those that tested our alpha and beta releases and those
that participated in the Fedora 19 Test day. Several issues were
uncovered and resolved due to your hard work.

**Important**: please see section *Upgrading* before upgrading the
packages, a manual procedure is needed for FreeIPA servers with CA
originally installed with FreeIPA version prior to 3.1.



Highlights in 3.2.0
-------------------



New features for 3.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Support installing FreeIPA without an embedded Certificate Authority,
   with user-provided SSL certificates for the HTTP and Directory
   servers. [1]
-  New cert-find command. Search certificates in the Dogtag database
   based on their serial number, validity or revocation details. This
   feature is available both as a CLI command and Web UI page. [2]
-  New trustconfig-show and trustconfig-mod command. Show or modify AD
   Trust settings generated during AD Trust installation
   (ipa-adtrust-install) [3]
-  Multiple FreeIPA servers can now be designated as Domain Controllers
   for trusts with Active Directory [12]
-  New realmdomains-show and realmdomains-mod command. Manage list of
   DNS domains associated with FreeIPA realm (realmdomains sommand).
   This list is primarily used by AD, which can pull all domains managed
   by FreeIPA and use that list for routing authentication requests for
   domains which do not match FreeIPA realm name. [4]
-  Support trusted domain users in HBAC test command (hbactest command).
-  Allow filtering incoming trusted domain SIDs per-trust (trust-mod
   command). [5]
-  Configurable PAC type for services. Service commands can now
   configure a set of PAC types (MS-PAC, PAD, no PAC) that are supported
   and handled for the service.
-  Faster UI loading. FreeIPA Web UI application is now packaged in
   minimalized format. FreeIPA web server is now also able to transmit
   data in compressed format. [6] [7]
-  UI now accepts confirmation of cancel of its dialogs via keyboard
   [11]
-  Client reenrollment. A host that has been recreated can now be
   reenrolled to FreeIPA server using a backed up host keytab or admin
   credentials [8]
-  Service and Host commands now provide options to add or remove
   selected Kerberos flags [9]
-  Full system backup and restore [13]
-  Experimental extensible interface for Web UI [14]
-  Source hosts have been completely removed from HBAC. They haven't
   been used by SSSD for quite some time and are being removed to avoid
   the suggestion that they might actually do something.
-  Web UI is now capable to translate SIDs to user and group names for
   external group members
-  Updated French, Ukranian and Spanish translations.



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Fixed migration from OpenLDAP. FreeIPA is now able to migrate users
   and groups from OpenLDAP database instances.
-  Migration process is now also a lot faster and provides more debug
   output (to httpd error log).
-  SUDO rules disabled by sudorule-disable command are now removed from

ou=sudoers compat tree without a need to restart 389 Directory Server
instance.

-  Fixed LDAP schema upgrade when upgrading from a pre-2.2.0 release
-  Fixed server installation with external CA (--external-ca)
-  Consolidate on-line help system, show help without need of valid
   Kerberos credentials (ipa help)
-  New LDAP plugin (ipa_dns) has been added to add missing idnsSOASerial

attribute for replicas which either do not have integrated DNS service
enabled to which have disabled SOA serial autoincrement

-  LDAP lockout plugin has been fixed so that lockout policies are
   applied consistently both for LDAP binds and Kerberos authentication
-  trust-resolve CLI command added to help resolving SIDs in Web UI to
   groups and users for external group members [16]
-  ... and many others stabilization fixes, see Detailed changelog for
   full details



Changes in API or CLI------------------



Dropped --selfsign option
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeIPA servers prior to 3.2.0 could be installed with --selfsign
option. This configured the server with a NSS database based Certificate
Authority with a selfsigned CA certificate and limited certificate
operation support.

This option was always intended for development or testing purposes only
and was not intended for use in production. This release drops this
option and deprecates the functionality. FreeIPA servers installed with
the --selfsign option will be converted to CA-less. See [15] for more
information and instructions for manual certificate management.

FreeIPA servers version 3.2.0 and later supports the following 2 flavors
of certificate management:

-  FreeIPA with pki-ca (dogtag) with either a self-signed certificate or
   with a certificate signed by external CA (--external-ca option)
-  FreeIPA with no pki-ca installed with certificates signed and
   provided by an external CA [1]



Dropped CSV support
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeIPA client CLI supported CSV in some arguments so that multiple
values could be added with just one convenient option:

| ``ipa permission-add some-perm --permissions=read,write --attrs=sn,cn``
| ``ipa dnsrecord-add example.com --a-rec=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2``

CSV parsing however introduces great difficulty when trying to include a
value with an embedded space in it. Escaping these values is not
intuitive and made it very difficult to add such values. The level of
effort in working around the CSV problems has come to the point where
the benefits of it are outweighed by the problems which lead to decision
to drop CSV support in CLI altogether [10].

There are several ways to workaround lack of CSV:

Provide an argument multiple times on the command-line:

| ``ipa permission-add some-perm --permissions=read --permissions=write --attrs=sn --attrs=cn``
| ``ipa dnsrecord-add example.com --a-rec=10.0.0.1 --a-rec=10.0.0.2``

Let BASH do the expansion for you:

| ``ipa permission-add some-perm --permissions={read,write} --attrs={sn,cn}``
| ``ipa dnsrecord-add example.com --a-rec={10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2}``

Upgrading
---------



FreeIPA servers with CA installed prior to version 3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Manual upgrade procedure <Howto/Dogtag9ToDogtag10Migration>`__ is
required for FreeIPA servers installed with version prior to
`3.1 <IPAv3_310>`__.



Other FreeIPA servers and clients
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Due to changes related to OCSP/CRL URI fix [1], ipa-ca.DOMAIN DNS name
is automatically converted from a set of CNAMEs to a set of A/AAAA
records pointing to FreeIPA servers with CA configured.

FreeIPA servers installed with the --selfsign option will be converted
to CA-less. See the section above titled "Dropped --selfsign option".

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.

mailing list (http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-users) or
