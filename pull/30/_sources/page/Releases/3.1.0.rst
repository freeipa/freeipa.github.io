The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version FreeIPA v3.1.0.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads.

A build will be submitted to updates-testing for Fedora 18 soon.



Highlights in 3.1.0
-------------------

-  A single 389-ds instance is used both for IPA identity data and for
   the dogtag CA server on new installs.
-  Support for Windows 2012 Server Trusts.
-  Verify that the IPA certificates are not tracked by certmonger after
   server uninstallation.
-  Enable 389-ds transactions.
-  If chronyd is running on a server disable it and replace it with ntpd
   by default.
-  Add new OCSP and CRL URIs to the IPA certificate profile for a new
   CNAME entry, ipa-ca.example.com.
-  Fix potential security error in cookie handling in ipa client tool,
   CVE-2012-5631.

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 is supported. Upgrading from previous versions is
not supported and has not been tested.

Upgrading from a previous version will not consolidate the 389-ds
instances. Only new installations get a unified 389-ds backend. Upgraded
servers will retain both instances.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
