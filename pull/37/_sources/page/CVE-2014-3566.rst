CVE-2014-3566
=============



CVE-2014-3566: POODLE: SSLv3 vulnerability
==========================================

Summary
-------

POODLE stands for Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption. This
vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to decrypt ciphertext
using a padding oracle side-channel attack.

POODLE affects older standards of encryption, specifically Secure Socket
Layer (SSL) version 3. It does not affect the newer encryption mechansim
known as Transport Layer Security (TLS).



Affected Versions
-----------------

All 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.0 and 4.1.

Impact
------

Low



Manual Instructions
-------------------

Disable SSLv3 in mod_nss.

Edit ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf`` and set ``NSSProtocol`` to
``TLSv1.0`` and ``TLSv1.1``.

::

   NSSProtocol TLSv1.0,TLSv1.1

Restart the httpd service

::

   # service httpd restart

NOTE: mod_nss only added support for TLSv1.2 in mid-October 2014 and
most distributions miss it. If your distribution includes mod_nss with
TLSv1.2 support, please use

::

   NSSProtocol TLSv1.0,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2



Versions of TLS supported by IPA
--------------------------------

IPA client code only supports SSLv3 and TLS v1.0 at this time.

TLSv1.1 can be enabled in mod_nss but it will not be used by the IPA
command-line tools. This is being tracked in `BZ
1154776 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1154776>`__
