IPAv2_221
=========

The FreeIPA team is proud to announce a bug fix release FreeIPA v2.2.1.

It can be downloaded from
` <http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads>`__\ http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads.

A build is on the way to updates-testing for Fedora 17. Fedora 15 and 16
are not supported by FreeIPA 2.2.1 due to missing dependencies.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

LDAP upgrade script in FreeIPA 2.2.1 contains a flawed index update
upgrade procedure, which may cause users not being able to authenticate
with server **upgraded** to FreeIPA 2.2.1. New installations are not
affected.

The issue is already `filed to FreeIPA
Trac <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3253>`__, to workaround
the issue, please run the following command after freeipa-server package
upgrade:

``# ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade``

After this command is run, FreeIPA should function properly.



Highlights in 2.2.1
-------------------

-  New Firefox extension able to configure browser for Kerberos support.
   The extension is required in Firefox 15 and later as updates to
   Firefox configuration via signed code is no longer supported
-  Web UI Host page fixed to work with disabled DNS
-  Client SSH configuration has been fixed to use GlobalKnownHostsFile
   instead of GlobalKnownHostsFile2 in as the latter has been deprecated
   in OpenSSH 5.9

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.
