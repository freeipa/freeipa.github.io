CVE-2013-0199
=============



CVE-2013-0199: Cross-Realm Trust key leak
-----------------------------------------

FreeIPA 3.0 introduced a Cross-Realm Kerberos trusts with Active
Directory, a feature that allows IPA administrators to create a Kerberos
trust with an AD. This allows IPA users to be able to access resources
in AD trusted domains and vice versa.

When the Kerberos trust is created, an outgoing and incoming keys are
stored in the IPA LDAP backend (in ipaNTTrustAuthIncoming and
ipaNTTrustAuthOutgoing attributes). However, the IPA LDAP ACIs allow
anonymous read acess to these attributes which could allow an
unprivileged user to read the keys. With these keys an attacker could
impersonate users and services of the opposite domain by crafting
special Kerberos tickets.



Affected Versions
-----------------

All 3.x versions.

The vulnerability is present only if AD Trusts are enabled and a trust
relationship is in place.

Impact
------

Medium

Acknowledgements
----------------

The bug was found by the FreeIPA team during an internal review.



Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

Administrators are advise to change their ACIs to block the
ipaNTTrustAuthIncoming and ipaNTTrustAuthOutgoing attributes from access
from non administrative users.

Once the new ACIs are in place it is recommended to change the trust
password. This can be accomplished by temporary deleting and then
recreating the trust agreement between the two domains using tha ipa
trust CLI commands.

Patches
-------

A patch to resolve this issue is available through our git repository:
http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/freeipa.git/commit/?id=d5966bde802d8ef84c202a3e7c85f17b9e305a30

Applying the patch prevents further access to keys but does NOT change
the trust secret.
