IPAv3_AD_trust
==============

-  Please note that git master of FreeIPA already includes support for
   establishing AD trusts. You can use
   http://freeipa.org/page/IPAv3_testing_AD_trust for instructions on
   how to test it.

   -  If the code is already in Fedora 18 updates, I'd just drop the
      "git master" information.
