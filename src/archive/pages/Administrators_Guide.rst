.. _managing_user_accounts:

Managing User Accounts
======================

The primary activities associated with managing user accounts, such as
creating and deleting accounts, are performed by IPA Administrators.
Other activities, such as editing various user account attributes,
changing group membership, etc., can be delegated to other accounts.

Refer to `#Delegating_Administrative_Privileges Delegating
Administrative
Privileges <#Delegating_Administrative_Privileges_Delegating_Administrative_Privileges>`__
for more information.

You can use either the Web interface or the command line to manage user
accounts. Each interface provides identical functionality, however the
Web interface displays a greater range of information for each user in
an easy to use format.

When you add new user accounts using the Web interface, mandatory fields
are shown in a different color. Certain other fields, such as Common
Name, Display Name, Initials, Login, and E-mail Address, are populated
automatically. You can change these values as required. The UID, GID,
and Home Directory are automatically generated by the server.

If you use the command line to add user accounts, you will be prompted
for any information that is required.

.. _creating_user_accounts:

Creating User Accounts
----------------------

.. _using_the_web_interface:

Using the Web Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. On the IPA Home Page, click **Add User** in the Tasks list to display
   the **Add User** page.
#. Enter the required details for the user.
#. If required, add the user account to a group. All users are
   automatically added to the global group *ipausers*.
#. When you have entered the required account details, click **Add
   User**.

..

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      It is not essential to provide a password when you create an
      account. For example, you might create an account for a service
      (rather than a user), and such an account may not require a
      password. For a user account, however, you need to provide an
      initial password so that the user can log in to their account.
      Users are required to change their initial password the first time
      they log in.

The following is an example of adding the Identity and Account details
for a new user using the Web interface.

`Using the Web interface to add a new user <image:AddUser.png>`__

.. _using_the_command_line:

Using the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the **ipa-adduser** command to add users to IPA. You can pass
attributes directly to the command, or run the command with no
parameters to enter interactive mode.

For example, to create the user *jlamb*:

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-adduser -f John -l Lamb -p secret jlamb

The following is an example of using the **ipa-adduser** command in
interactive mode to create a user account:

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-adduser
   First name: Jinny
   Last name: Pattanajee
   Login name: jpattan
     Password:
     Password (again):
   gecos[]: Jinny Pattanajee
   home directory [/home/jpattan]:
   shell [/bin/sh]:
   jpattan successfully added

Press **Enter** to accept the default values (provided in square
brackets), or enter an alternative.

Refer to the **ipa-adduser** man page for more information.

.. _editing_user_accounts:

Editing User Accounts
---------------------

Members of the IPA Administrators group can edit any of the details of
any user account. Other users may also be able to edit certain details
of user accounts, according to the delegations that have been
configured.

.. _using_the_web_interface_1:

Using the Web Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Click **Find Users** in the Tasks list to display the **Find Users**
   page.
#. Enter the name or a key word of the user that you want to edit in the
   search field, and click **Find Users**.
#. In the search results, click the name of the user that you want to
   edit. The user is displayed on the **View User** page. If the user
   does not appear in the search results, try using broader search
   terms.
#. Click **Edit User** to display the **Edit User** page. This displays
   the various fields where you can edit user attributes.
#. Edit the user attributes as required, and click **Update User**. Note
   that not all fields are immediately editable; you need to select the
   **Edit Protected Fields** checkbox to edit the **Password**, **Home
   Directory**, and some other fields.

..

   |Caution.png| **Caution:**

      It is possible to edit the UID and GID of user accounts, however
      this is not recommended. Changing these IDs will not cause
      problems internally for IPA, but it can lead to other issues such
      as changes to file ownership, security problems, etc.

.. _using_the_command_line_1:

Using the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the **ipa-moduser** command to modify user account details, such as
adding, removing or changing attributes.

**To update the Zip code, Display Name, and Employee Type for the user
jsmith:**

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-moduser --set postalCode=50211 --set displayName="John Smith" --set employeeType=permanent jsmith

**To remove the Pager and Home Phone attributes from the same user:**

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-moduser --del pager --del homePhone jsmith

.. _activating_and_inactivating_user_accounts:

Activating and Inactivating User Accounts
-----------------------------------------

IPA user accounts can be set to a status of *Active* or *Inactive*. If
you inactivate a user account, that user can no longer log in to IPA,
change their password, or perform any other functions. The account and
all associated information still exists, but is inaccessible by the
user.

.. _using_the_web_interface_2:

Using the Web Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Find the user that you want to inactivate as described
   `above. <#Editing_User_Accounts>`__
#. Click **Edit User** to display the **Edit User** page. This displays
   the various fields where you can edit user attributes.
#. In the **Account Details** section, select **inactive** in the
   **Account Status** drop-down list, and then click **Update User**.

The account will remain inactive and inaccessible to the user until
reactivated by an IPA Administrator.

.. _using_the_command_line_2:

Using the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the **ipa-lockuser** command to activate or inactivate user
accounts.

**To lock (inactivate) the jsmith user account:**

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-lockuser jsmith

**To unlock (activate) the jsmith user account:**

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-lockuser -u jsmith

.. _deleting_user_accounts:

Deleting User Accounts
----------------------

If you delete a user account, all of the information for that identity
is lost. The actual user account, home directory and other information
still exists, be it on a server, local machine, or some other provider,
but it is no longer accessible via IPA.

Unlike with inactivation, if you delete a user account, it cannot be
retrieved. If you find that you need this user account again, you need
to recreate it and add all of the account details manually.

.. _using_the_web_interface_3:

Using the Web Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Find the user that you want to delete as described
   `above. <#Editing_User_Accounts>`__
#. Click **Edit User** to display the **Edit User** page.
#. Click **Delete User**, and then click **OK**.

.. _using_the_command_line_3:

Using the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the **ipa-deluser** command to delete user accounts. For example, to
delete the *jsmith* user account:

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-deluser jsmith

.. _managing_groups:

Managing Groups
===============

IPA uses groups to facilitate the management and administration of both
users and permissions. Three groups are created by default during the
installation process: *ipausers*, *admins*, and *editors*. The IPA
Administrator is a member of the *admins* group; you can not remove the
IPA Administrator from this group, nor can you remove the Administrator
or *admins* group. These are all required for IPA operation. All other
users belong to the global group *ipausers*, and you can create as many
additional groups as you require. The *editors* group is a special group
whose members have certain administrative permissions within IPA,
however these permissions are not as extensive as those of IPA
Administrators.

You can create groups based on the departments within your organization,
for example, Engineering, Finance, and HR. You can also create groups
based on the permissions, or *roles*, required to manage your
departmental or other groups.

You can also create nested groups. For example, you can create a group
called "Documentation", within which you could create groups called
"Writers", "Editors", and "Translators". You can add users to each of
the sub-groups to suit the needs of your organization.

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      Any users that you add to a sub-group automatically become members
      of the parent group.

..

   |Caution.png| **Caution:**

      You should avoid the creation of cyclic groups - groups whose
      members include groups that contain their own parents - because it
      can lead to unexpected behavior.

Refer to `Access Control and
Delegation <#Access_Control_and_Delegation>`__ for information on using
groups to define roles.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. On the IPA Home Page, click **Add Group** in the Tasks list to
   display the **Add Group** page.
#. Enter a name and description for the group. The GID (Group ID) is
   automatically generated by the IPA server.
#. If required, enter any users that you want to be members of this
   group:

   #. Enter the login name or other search term in the **To Add** field,
      and click **Find**.
   #. Locate the users that you want to be members of this group, and
      click **add**.

#. When you have finished adding members, click **Add Group**.

If the group is successfully added, the server returns to the **View
Group** page, and displays details about the newly-added group.

The following diagram illustrates adding members to a new group.

Editing Groups
--------------

You can edit any of the attributes that define a group, as well as add
or remove members. Some attributes are read-only by default, however you
can elect to edit these attributes if required.

   Note that if you want to change the Name or GID of the group, you
   need to select the **Edit Protected Fields** checkbox.

..

   |Caution.png| **Caution:**

      You should not change the Group Name or GID unless absolutely
      necessary, because it can have unexpected affects on permissions,
      ACIs, and other aspects of IPA functionality.

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      You can click **Cancel Edit** at any time to cancel editing the
      group and abandon any changes.

.. _using_the_command_line_5:

Using the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the **ipa-modgroup** command to edit groups. Refer to the
**ipa-modgroup** man page for the various options available.

.. _activating_and_inactivating_groups:

Activating and Inactivating Groups
----------------------------------

IPA groups can be set to a status of *Active* or *Inactive*. If you
inactivate a group, all of the members of that group are also
inactivated. This means that they cannot log in to IPA, change
passwords, or perform any other functions. The accounts within an
inactivated group still exist, but they are inaccessible.

This also applies to nested groups. If you inactivate a group, then any
groups within that group are also inactivated, as are their members. You
can override the cascading effect of inactivation by activating
individual users or groups.

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      You cannot inactivate the *admins* group.

.. _using_the_web_interface_6:

Using the Web Interface

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-modgroup --set nsaccountlock=true Engineering

**To activate the Finance group:**

::

   $ /usr/sbin/ipa-modgroup --set nsaccountlock=false Finance

.. _deleting_groups:

Deleting Groups
---------------

If you delete a group, only the immediate group is removed; members of
the group are not affected. That is, unlike inactivation, there is no
cascading effect when you delete a group.

Note that when you delete a group, any delegations that you might have
set up that rely on that group will also be removed. For example,
suppose you added an *Engineering Manager* group specifically to set up
delegations for the Engineering Manager. If you deleted the *Engineering
Manager* group, then those delegations would also be lost. Unlike with
inactivation, these cannot be retrieved. If you find that you need this
group and delegation again, you need to recreate them.

.. _managing_certificates_and_certificate_authorities:

Managing Certificates and Certificate Authorities
=================================================

If you have your own or a preferred Certificate Authority (CA) and want
to use your own certificates, IPA provides the necessary tools to import
certificates for use by the Directory Server and HTTP Server. While not
a prerequisite for the correct operation of IPA, you should also save an
ASCII copy of your CA certificate as ``/usr/share/ipa/html/ca.crt`` to
ensure that customers download the correct certificate.

.. _installing_your_own_certificate:

Installing Your Own Certificate
-------------------------------

Use the **ipa-server-certinstall** command to install your own
certificate. You can install the certificate for use by the Directory
Server, HTTP Server, or both.

**To install the certificate for use by the Directory Server:**

::

   # /usr/sbin/ipa-server-certinstall -d /path/to/pkcs12.p12

.. _using_your_own_certificate_with_firefox:

Using Your Own Certificate with Firefox
---------------------------------------

To continue using the Firefox auto-configuration feature, you need an
object-signing certificate, and you need to regenerate the
``/usr/share/ipa/html/configure.jar`` file.

**Use the following series of commands to:**

#. Create a directory to host the certificate database.
#. Create the new certificate database.
#. Import the signing certificate.

..

   .. figure:: Note.png
      :alt: Note.png

      Note.png

   **Note:** The following procedure assumes that the signing
   certificate is provided as a PKCS#12 file.

::

   # mkdir /tmp/signdb
   # /usr/bin/certutil -N -d /tmp/signdb
   # /usr/bin/pk12util -i /path/to/pkcs12.p12 -d /tmp/signdb

**Use the following series of commands to:**

#. Make a temporary signing directory.
#. Copy the IPA javascript file to the temporary signing directory.
#. Use the certificate you created in the previous procedure to sign the
   javascript and to regenerate the ``configure.jar`` file.

::

   # mkdir /tmp/sign
   # cp /usr/share/ipa/html/preferences.html /tmp/sign
   # /usr/bin/signtool -d /tmp/signdb -k Signing_cert_nickname -Z\
    /usr/share/ipa/html/configure.jar -e .html

.. _managing_service_principals:

Managing Service Principals
===========================

Apart from authenticating users, Kerberos can also provide
authentication for services that are accessed by users. For example, you
can use Kerberos to provide authentication for HTTP, SSH, and other
services. In this scenario, mutual authentication must occur between the
service and the KDC (rather than between the user and the KDC). That is,
each service must have a valid principal (the *service principal*) on
the server, and the service must use a shared secret to authenticate
against the KDC. This is true if the service is provided on the same
machine as the KDC, or on a separate machine.

.. _service_principals_and_key_tables_keytabs:

Service Principals and Key Tables (keytabs)
-------------------------------------------

Clients use the service principal to tell the KDC which service they
need a ticket for. The KDC uses the service principal to provide a
secret key to the service when the service principal is created. Service
principals and their associated keys are stored in a *keytab* file.
Without an appropriate keytab the service has no way of authenticating a
client, and the KDC has no way of providing the client with a ticket.

It is important to understand the critical role that service principals
and their associated keys play, especially when those services are
accessed by multiple users. While a valid ticket exists for a specific
service, users can access that service using their Kerberos credentials.
For example, if a user tries to mount an NFS directory using Kerberos,
then both the NFS server and the user require a valid principal, and
share a secret key with the KDC. This is established during the IPA NFS
configuration on the server. If the secret key is replaced on the
server, for example, by getting a new keytab, then you need to ensure
that the new keytab is exported to any clients that need NFS mount
access to the server. Failure to export an updated keytab can cause
problems that are difficult to isolate. For example, existing service
connections may continue to function, but no new connections may be
possible.

   |Caution.png| **Caution:**

      Clients attempting to mount NFS exports rely on the existence of a
      valid principal and secret key on both the NFS server and the
      client machine.

Service principals are typically released per service, although it is
possible for one service principal to be used for more than one service.

.. _creating_and_using_service_principals:

Creating and Using Service Principals
-------------------------------------

You can use the WebUI to search for any issued service principals, and
also to create new service principals. For security and other reasons,
however, it is not possible to retrieve a keytab using the WebUI. This
has to be done either on the command line on the system where the
service is accessed, or on the IPA server itself, and the keytab then
exported to the client machine.

The following example demonstrates creating a service principal and
keytab on a client machine for the SSH service. The client machine is
*ipaclient.example.com* and the IPA server is *ipaserver.example.com*:

::

   # kinit admin
   # ipa-addservice host/ipaclient.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
   # ipa-getkeytab -s ipaserver.example.com -p host/ipaclient.example.com -k /etc/krb5.keytab

..

   |Note.png| **Notes:**

   -  The realm name is optional. The IPA server automatically appends
      the Kerberos realm for which it is configured. You cannot specify
      a different realm.

   -  The hostname must resolve to a DNS A record in order to ensure
      that it will work with Kerberos. You can use the **--force** flag
      to force the creation of a principal should this prove necessary.

   -  The **ipa-getkeytab** command is part of the **``ipa-client``**
      package, which is only available for clients running Red Hat
      Enterprise Linux 4 or 5, Fedora 7, 8, or 9. For other clients, you
      need to use this procedure on the server and manually copy the
      keytab to the client.

   -  You can use the **-e** flag to include a comma-separated list of
      encryption types to include in the keytab. This supercedes any
      default encryption type. Refer to the **ipa-getkeytab** man page
      for more information.

   |Caution.png| **Caution:**

      The **ipa-getkeytab** command resets the secret for the specified
      principal. This means that all other keytabs for that principal
      are rendered invalid.

.. _configuring_nfs_on_the_ipa_server:

Configuring NFS on the IPA Server
---------------------------------

The following procedure describes how to configure NFS on the IPA server
and to set up an NFS service principal.

1. Configure the export directory.

::

   # mkdir /export
   # chmod 777 /export

2. Configure the ``/etc/exports`` file as follows:

::

   /export  *(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check)
   /export  gss/krb5(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check)
   /export  gss/krb5i(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check)
   /export  gss/krb5p(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check)

3. To enable secure NFS, add the following line to
``/etc/sysconfig/nfs``

::

   SECURE_NFS=yes

4. Add a service principal and keytab for NFS.

::

   # ipa-addservice nfs/ipaserver.example.com
   # ipa-getkeytab -s ipaserver.example.com -p nfs/ipaserver.example.com -k /etc/krb5.keytab

..

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      The Linux NFS implementation still has limited encryption type
      support. You may need to use the **-e des-cbc-crc** to the
      **ipa-getkeytab** command for any **nfs/<FQDN>** service keytab
      you want to set up, both on the server and on all clients. This
      will instruct the KDC to generate only DES keys.

5. Run the following series of commands to reload the NFS configuration
and restart the required services:

::

   # exportfs -a
   # restart services
   # service nfs restart
   # service rpcgssd restart

.. _access_control_and_delegation:

Access Control and Delegation
=============================

IPA supports access control using a process known as *delegation*. This
provides a means of assigning different permissions to the various users
and groups that you create.

When the IPA server is initially configured, it creates an
administrative account named **admin**. You use this initial account to
create any further administrative or other accounts required by your
deployment.

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      The **admin** account cannot be deleted or renamed, nor can it be
      removed from the **admins** group.

Normally you would delegate access control to a group, or *role*. For
example, you might create one group called "Engineering Manager" and
another called "Office Manager". These would be dedicated groups for the
Engineering Manager and Office Manager respectively.

You would then create a delegation to specify the permissions associated
with each group. An Engineering Manager might be able to modify the
attributes of everyone in the Engineering group, and the Office Manager
would be able to change details related to the office, such as fax
numbers, office contacts, etc.

When you add the Engineering Manager to the Engineering Manager group,
they automatically gain all of the associated permissions. If the person
holding that position changes, you simply change the groups that that
user belongs to. There is no need to modify any other values.

.. _delegating_administrative_privileges:

Delegating Administrative Privileges
------------------------------------

**To delegate administrative privileges:**

#. Create the group to which you want to delegate administrative
   privileges (the *source*).
#. Create the group over which this group should have administrative
   privileges (the *target*).
#. On the IPA home page, click **Delegations** in the Tasks list to open
   the **Delegations** page.
#. Click **Add New Delegation** to open the **Add Delegation** page.
#. In the **Delegation Name** field, type a descriptive name for the
   delegation.
#. In the **People in Group** field, enter the CN of the group or type a
   suitable search term and click **Find**. This is to determine the
   *source*, or the group that will *receive* the delegation.
#. In the search results, click the required group name. If the required
   group does not appear in the search results, try a different search
   term to widen your search.
#. In the **Can Modify** list, select the appropriate check boxes for
   the delegations that you want to apply. For example, you can specify
   that this group can modify the home directory, login shell, and org
   unit of its subjects.
#. In the **For People in Group** field, enter the CN of the group or
   type a suitable search term and click **Find**. This is to determine
   the group that will be subject to the delegation.
#. Click **Add Delegation** to create the delegation.

..

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      You can only create a delegation for one target at a time. If you
      require that a source have administrative control over several
      targets, you need to create a separate delegation for each target.

The following diagram illustrates creating a delegation for the
Engineering Manager over the Engineering group.

`Adding a delegation to a group <image:AddDelegation.png>`__

.. _configuring_host_based_access_control:

Configuring Host-Based Access Control
-------------------------------------

You can configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora to allow or deny
access to IPA resources and services based on the configuration of the
host from which access is attempted. This requires modification to the
``/etc/security/access.conf`` and ``/etc/pam.d/system-auth`` files, as
described below:

1. Modify the ``/etc/security/access.conf`` file to include the
following lines:

::

   + : root : ALL
   + : ipausers : ALL
   - : ALL : ALL

2. Modify the ``/etc/pam.d/system-auth`` file to include the following
line:

::

   account required pam_access.so

This configuration specifies that:

-  The root user can log in.
-  All IPA users can log in.
-  IPA admins can not log in.

.. _managing_ipa_policy:

Managing IPA Policy
===================

The IPA policy specifies various constraints on the way that users can
interact with IPA system as a whole. This affects their user accounts,
the details that they can view and edit, minimum password requirements,
etc., and also the range of searches that they can perform.

.. _specifying_search_settings:

Specifying Search Settings
--------------------------

You can configure various aspects of the IPA search functionality to
suit your deployment. For example, you can restrict the number of fields
that a user can base a search on, or limit the number of records
returned for any particular search.

IPA supports the following search configuration attributes:

-  **Search Time Limit:** The maximum time, in seconds, that a search
   will run before failing.
-  **Search Records Limit:** The maximum number of records that a search
   can return. Set this value to zero (0) to specify no limit. The
   directory server limit (the default value is 2000) still applies.
-  **User Search Fields:** This specifies the fields to search within
   user details for the values entered by a user.
-  **Group Search Fields:** This specifies the fields to search within
   group details for the values entered by a user.

.. _specifying_the_password_policy:

Specifying the Password Policy
------------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

IPA supports the specification of various password attributes that help
to ensure the security of your system, and also that of individual user
accounts. You can specify the password lifetime, length, and the types
of characters required in a password, all as part of the IPA Password
Policy.

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      In IPA 1.0, the password policy is enforced by the KDC. Only a
      limited number of attributes are currently supported, however this
      will be extended in later versions.

      Because the password policy is enforced by the KDC, any further
      policy specifications that you implement as part of the Directory
      Server password policy will not be visible in IPA, and neither
      will they be enforced.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you reset a password using "cn=Directory Manager" credentials (only
possible if you manually perform an LDAP password change operation) then
you override any checks and the password is set to whatever you specify.
The IPA password policy is ignored.

.. _changing_passwords_as_the_ipa_administrator:

Changing Passwords as the IPA Administrator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you reset a password using "admin" credentials (that is, as part of
the **admins** group), the IPA password policy is ignored, but the
expiration date is set to "now". This means that the user is forced to
change their password immediately, and the password policy is then
enforced. This is also true for users who have had password changing
rights delegated to them.

This is done so that the administrator can easily create users with
"default" passwords and reset user's passwords, but will not know the
actual, final password entered by the user. Further, any password that
is trasmitted from the administrator to the user, even over insecure
channels, is a temporary password. Consequently, it is not critical if
it is accidentally disclosed, provided that the user promptly resets it.

.. _changing_passwords_as_a_regular_user:

Changing Passwords as a Regular User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are logged in as a regular user (that is, you are not part of the
**admins** group, or possessed of any elevated privileges), then you can
only change your own password, and these changes are always subject to
the IPA password policy.

.. _editing_the_password_policy:

Editing the Password Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use either the Web interface or the command-line to edit the IPA
password policy. However, you can only edit those attributes supported
by IPA.

.. _using_the_web_interface_8:

Using the Web Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Click **Manage Policy** in the Tasks list, and then click **IPA
   Policy** to display the **Manage IPA Policy** page.
#. Click **Edit Policy** to display the **Edit IPA Policy** page. This
   displays the various fields where you can edit different aspects of
   the IPA policy.
#. In the **Password Policy** section, edit the password attributes as
   required, and click **Update Policy**.

.. _using_the_command_line_8:

Using the Command-Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the **ipa-pwpolicy** command to modify IPA password policy details.
This command uses the following syntax:

   ``ipa-pwpolicy [--maxlife days] [--minlife hours] [--history number] [--minclasses number] [--minlength number]``

For example, to update the minimum password length to 10 characters, and
to specify that no history of passwords be kept:

   ``# /usr/sbin/ipa-pwpolicy --minlength 10 --history 0``

Refer to the next section for information on password policy attributes.

Refer to the **ipa-pwpolicy** man page for more information on this
command.

.. _password_policy_attributes:

Password Policy Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The password policy is enforced by the **pwd_extop slapi** plug-in. IPA
1.0 supports the following password policy attributes:

-  **Minimum Password Lifetime (krbMinPwdLife):** The minimum period of
   time, in hours, that a user's password must be in effect before the
   user can change it. The default value is one hour.

   You can use this attribute to prevent users from changing their
   password to a "temporary" value and then immediately changing it back
   to the original value.

-  **Maximum Password Lifetime (krbMaxPwdLife):** The maximum period of
   time, in days, that a user's password can be in effect before it must
   be changed. The default value is 90 days.
-  **Minimum Number of Character Classes (krbPwdMinDiffChars):** The
   minimum number of different classes, or types, of character that must
   exist in a password before it is considered valid. The default value
   is zero (0).

   For example, setting **krbPwdMinDiffChars = 3** requires that
   passwords contain at least one character from three of the supported
   classes.
   The following character classes are supported:

   -  Upper-case characters
   -  Lower-case characters
   -  Digits
   -  Special characters (for example, punctuation)

   The following special classes also exist:

   -  Number of repeated characters

      This weights in the opposite direction, so that if you have too
      many repeated characters you will not meet the quorum to satisfy
      the "level" expressed by **krbPwdMinDiffChars**

-  **Minimum Length of Password (krbPwdMinLength):** The minimum number
   of characters that must exist in a password before it is considered
   valid. The default value is eight characters.
-  **Password History Size (krbPwdHistoryLength):** The number of
   previous passwords that IPA stores, and which a user is prevented
   from using. For example, if you set this value to 10, the IPA server
   prevents a user from reusing any of their previous 10 passwords. The
   default value is zero (0) (disable password history).

..

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      If password history checking is enabled, and a user attempts to
      use one of the passwords in the history list, the error message
      returned by the system may be misleading. For example, you may see
      the following error:

   ::

      A database error occurred: Constraint violation: Password fails to meet minimum strength criteria

      This is because ``python-ldap`` prevents the retrieval of extended
      information on password policy failures over LDAP. There is
      currently no workaround for this limitation.

Refer to `Password
Security <http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-5-manual/en-US/RHEL510/Deployment_Guide/s1-wstation-pass.html>`__
on http://www.redhat.com/docs/ for information on implementing a sound
password security policy for your organization.

.. _notifying_users_of_password_expiration:

Notifying Users of Password Expiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Future versions of IPA will support the concept of automatic user
notification when passwords are due to expire. This feature is not
available in IPA 1.0. You can, however, manually search for passwords
that are due to expire by a specified date.

For example, to retrieve all user entries whose password is due to
expire before March 1st, 2008, run the following command:

   $ ldapsearch -Y GSSAPI -b "cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com"
   '(krbPasswordExpiration<=20080301000000Z)'

.. _using_password_authentication:

Using Password Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use password authentication (no GSSAPI authentication, no ticket
on the client) with a new user or a user whose password has expired, you
need to enable Challenge-Response authentication. Otherwise, the
password changing dialog will not display.

This is not enabled by default because some older SSH clients may not
support Challenge-Response authentication, and it is needed only if the
password has expired.

**To enable Challenge-Response authentication:**

-  Set ChallengeResponseAuthentication to "yes" in
   ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config``

.. _using_local_logins:

Using Local Logins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default settings specified by the IPA installation script include
timeout settings that still allow local logins to succeed if the client
cannot access the IPA server. These settings are specified in the
``/etc/ldap.conf`` file, and can be tuned to suit your particular
deployment. A typical deployment would normally include two or more
servers for redundancy, and so this would not normally be a problem.

   |Caution.png| **Caution:**

      These timeout settings are only set on operating systems that
      support the IPA installation script. On other operating systems,
      you need to specify these values manually. Failure to do so can
      result in the inability to log in to the machine if no IPA servers
      are available.

.. _specifying_user_settings:

Specifying User Settings
------------------------

You can specify a range of attributes that are automatically applied to
each new user account that you create. Any changes that you make to the
default settings only apply to newly created accounts; existing accounts
are not affected.

.. _using_the_web_interface_9:

Using the Web Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Click **Manage Policy** in the Tasks list, and then click **IPA
   Policy** to display the **Manage IPA Policy** page.
#. Click **Edit Policy** to display the **Edit IPA Policy** page. This
   displays the various fields where you can edit different aspects of
   the IPA policy.
#. In the **User Settings** section, edit the user setting attributes as
   required, and then click **Update Policy**.

   **Editing the default user settings for the IPA Policy.**

.. _user_setting_attributes:

User Setting Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IPA supports the following User Setting attributes:

-  **Max. Username Length:** Maximum length of any username. Default is
   8.
-  **Root for Home Directories:** The root directory for all users' home
   directories. Default is ``/home``
-  **Default Shell:** The default shell for all user accounts. Default
   is ``/bin/sh``
-  **Default User Group:** The default group to which all newly created
   accounts are added. The default is **ipausers**, which is
   automatically created during IPA server installation process.
-  **Default E-mail Domain:** The default domain used to create e-mail
   addresses for all newly created accounts. The default is the domain
   to which the IPA server belongs.
-  **Default User Object Classes:** The default list of object classes
   that can be used to add attributes to user accounts.
-  **Default Group Object Classes:** The default list of object classes
   that can be used to add attributes to groups.

..

   |Note.png| **Note:**

      The default root directory for users' home directories is
      ``/home``, but it is the responsibility of the system
      administrator to ensure that whatever value is specified for this
      attribute is actually available.

      Red Hat Enterprise Linux and most other Linux distributions
      include a pam module called *pam_mkhomedir* that can be used to
      automatically create a home directory if one does not exist for
      the user authenticating against the system. IPA does not force the
      use of this module because it may try to create home directories
      even when the shared storage is simply not available. It is the
      responsibility of the system administrator to activate this module
      on the clients if needed.

      If a suitable directory and mechanism are not available for the
      creation of home directories, users may not be able to log in
      successfully.

clients with a freeIPA 1.2 server.

.. _automount_issues:

Automount Issues
----------------

.. _additional_schema_required_for_some_systems:

Additional Schema Required for Some Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are supporting Solaris clients, you will need the 2307bis style
automount schema, although Sun's version is NOT identical to the one at
http://people.redhat.com/nalin/schema/autofs.schema.

This is the recommended schema for IPA:

::

   dn: cn=schema
   attributeTypes:
     ( 1.3.6.1.1.1.1.31 NAME 'automountMapName'
       DESC 'automount Map Name'
       EQUALITY caseExactIA5Match

       X-ORIGIN 'RFC 2307bis' )

.. _configuration_steps_in_detail:

Configuration Steps in Detail
-----------------------------

The following sections provide instructions on how to create the autofs
mount entries for LDAP that will work in at least Linux and Solaris
clients.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you begin, ensure that:

-  The IPA server is up and running.
-  Your domain is example.com.
-  You have root access to the server where you want autofs to work.
   (For the purposes of this exercise, this server is called
   nfsserver.example.com)
-  The nfsserver.example.com server can communicate with the ldap server
   for users/groups.
-  The NFS service is running on nfsserver.example.com. Configuring NFS
   is beyond the scope of this document, but an entry in the
   ``/etc/exports`` file looks something like this:

   ``/home 192.168.1.0/16(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check,sync,anonuid=65534,anongid=65534)``

Test from the command line that you can mount the ``/home`` directory.
This helps to eliminate suspects if the configuration does not work.

.. _install_the_schema:

Install the Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Put the above schema into the file
``/etc/dirsrv/slapd-INSTANCE/schema/75autofs.ldif`` and restart your
server.

For this to apply to any future Directory Server instances you may
create also put this into ``/etc/dirsrv/schema``.

Alternatively you can load the schema with ldapmodify.

Restart the Directory Server to pick up this file.

.. _creating_auto.master:

Creating auto.master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that the schema is loaded you can create the auto.master map. On
Solaris this is referred to as auto_master but we can map that name
later.

The first step is to create the top-level entry to store automount maps.

These entries can be added with:
``ldapmodify -D "cn=Directory Manager"``

::

   dn: cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: nsContainer
   cn: automount

Now create the auto.master map:

::

   dn: automountmapname=auto.master,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automountMap
   automountmapname: auto.master

Now create an automount map under auto.master for ``/home``

::

   dn: automountmapname=auto.home,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automountMap
   automountMapName: auto.home

This entry informs autofs where to get the mount information for
``/home``

.. _creating_auto.home:

Creating auto.home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an automount key for auto.home:

::

   dn: automountkey=*,automountmapname=auto.home,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automount
   automountKey: *
   automountInformation: nfsserver.example.com:/home/&

   dn: automountkey=/home,automountmapname=auto.master,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automount
   automountKey: /home
   automountInformation: auto.home

This creates a wild-card map so that any user that logs in will have
``/home/username`` mounted for them.

.. _linux_autofs:

Linux autofs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the ``/etc/sysconfig/autofs`` file and enable the following lines
to tell autofs what attributes to search for:

::

   #
   # Other common LDAP nameing
   #
   MAP_OBJECT_CLASS="automountMap"
   ENTRY_OBJECT_CLASS="automount"
   MAP_ATTRIBUTE="automountMapName"
   ENTRY_ATTRIBUTE="automountKey"
   VALUE_ATTRIBUTE="automountInformation"

You'll also need to tell it which LDAP server to use and what the search
basedn is:

::

   LDAP_URI="ldap://ipa.example.com"

   SEARCH_BASE="cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com"

Save the file and restart autofs:

::

   [root@remote_system ~]# service autofs restart

Test the configuration by getting a directory listing of a user:

::

   root@remote_system ~]# ls /home/someuser

If this does not mount the remote filesystem check the
``/var/log/messages`` file for errors or other indications of what the
problem might be. You can also increase the debug level in the
``/etc/sysconfig/autofs`` file by setting LOGGING to debug.

.. _solaris_automount:

Solaris automount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the NFS server is a Linux server, first tell Solaris that the maximum
supported NFS version is 3 by editing ``/etc/default/nfs`` and setting
``NFS_CLIENT_VERSMAX=3``

You will be using the native nss_ldap to do the automount mapping.

We will be doing an anonymous bind to the IPA Directory Server. The Sun
automount server needs access to the VLV control so anonymous access is
needed. This command comes from
http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-5201/6n7a588i7?l=ja&a=view

::

   # ldapmodify -D "cn=Directory Manager" ipa.example.com
   dn: oid=2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.9,cn=features,cn=config 
   changetype: modify
   add: aci
   aci: (targetattr !="aci") (version 3.0; acl "VLV Request Control"; allow (compare,read,search) userdn = "ldap:///anyone"; )

Configure your machine to use LDAP manually with ldapclient:

::

   ldapclient -v manual -a authenticationMethod=none \
    -a defaultSearchBase=dc=example,dc=com \
    -a defaultServerList=ipa.example.com \
    -a serviceSearchDescriptor=passwd:cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com \
    -a serviceSearchDescriptor=group:cn=groups,cn=compat,dc=example,dc=com \
    -a serviceSearchDescriptor=auto_master:automountMapName=auto.master,cn=automoun
   t,dc=example,dc=com?one \
    -a serviceSearchDescriptor=auto_home:automountMapName=auto.home,cn=automount,dc
   =example,dc=com?one \
    -a objectClassMap=shadow:shadowAccount=posixAccount \
    -a searchTimelimit=15 \
    -a bindTimeLimit=5

Now enable automount:

::

   # svcadm enable svc:/system/filesystem/autofs

You can test if things are working first with:

::

   # ldaplist -l auto_master
   dn: automountkey=/home,automountmapname=auto.master,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
           objectClass: automount
           objectClass: top
           automountKey: /home
           automountInformation: auto.home

And then with:

::

   # ls /home/someuser

Assuming you don't already have a filesystem on /home then a directory
listing of /home/someuser should appear.

Running ``automount -v`` will show if there are any conflicts such as
already mounted directories.

auto.direct
~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a direct mount configuration, add the following entries:

::

   dn: automountkey=/-,automountmapname=auto.master,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automount
   automountKey: '/-'
   automountInformation: auto.direct

   automountmapname=auto.direct,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automountMap
   automountMapName: auto.direct

To add a mount to this direct map for the directory /share you'd add:

::

   dn: automountkey=/share,automountmapname=auto.direct,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automount
   automountKey: /share
   automountInformation: nfsserver.example.com:/share

On Solaris you'd need to augment the ldapclient command with:

::

    -a serviceSearchDescriptor=auto_direct:automountMapName=auto.direct,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com?one \

.. _indirect_maps:

indirect maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example of an indirect map for /usr/man. We provide one map,
/usr/man/man1.

These three entries provide:

#. A new automount map named auto.man
#. Adds auto.man to auto.master on the mount point /usr/man
#. Adds an indirect mount of man1 to auto.man

::

   dn: automountmapname=auto.man,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automountMap
   automountMapName: auto.man

   dn: automountkey=/usr/man,automountmapname=auto.master,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automount
   automountKey: /usr/man
   automountInformation: auto.man

   dn: automountkey=man1,automountmapname=auto.man,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com
   objectClass: automount
   automountKey: man1
   automountInformation: nfsserver.example.com:/export/manpages/man1

On Solaris you'd need to augment the ldapclient command with:

::

    -a serviceSearchDescriptor=auto_man:automountMapName=auto.man,cn=automount,dc=example,dc=com?one \
