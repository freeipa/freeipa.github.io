The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA 4.5.0 release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Builds
for Fedora 25 and Fedora 26 will be available soon in the official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/freeipa/freeipa-4-5/>`__.

.. _highlights_in_4.5.0:

Highlights in 4.5.0
-------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _ad_user_short_names:

AD User Short Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for AD users short names has been added. Short names can be
enabled from CLI by setting
``ipa config-mod --domain-resolution-order="domain.test:ad.domain1.test:ad.domain2.test"``
or from WebUI under *Configuration* tab. No manual configuration on SSSD
side is required.

Please note that this feature is not supported by SSSD yet and the work
is tracked with <https://pagure.io/SSSD/sssd/issue/3210>

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/AD_User_Short_Names>

.. _fips_140_2_support:

FIPS 140-2 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FreeIPA server and client can be installed on FIPS enabled systems. MD5
fingerprints have been replaced with SHA256. Variable *fips_mode* has
been added to env that indicates whether FIPS is turned on the server.

Please note that FIPS 140-2 support may not work on some platforms
because all dependencies of FreeIPA must support FIPS 140-2 what we
cannot guarantee. (Should work with RHEL 7.4+.) The FreeIPA code itself
is FIPS 140-2 compatible.

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/FreeIPA-on-FIPS>

.. _certificate_identity_mapping:

Certificate Identity Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for multiple certificates on Smart cards has been added. User
can choose which certificate is used to authenticate. This allows to
define multiple certificates per user. The same certificate can be used
by different accounts, and the mapping between a certificate and an
account can be done through binary match of the whole certificate or a
match on custom certificate attributes (such as Subject + Issuer).

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Certificate_Identity_Mapping>

.. _improvements_for_containerization:

Improvements for Containerization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AD trust and KRA can be installed in one step in containers without need
to call subsequent ipa-adtrust-install and ipa-kra-install in
containers. Option *--setup-adtrust* has been added to
*ipa-server-install* and *ipa-replica-install*, and option *--setup-kra*
has been added to *ipa-server-install*.

-  <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6731>
-  <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6630>

.. _semi_automatic_integration_with_external_dns:

Semi-automatic Integration with External DNS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Option "--out" has been added to command "ipa
dns-update-system-records". This option allows to store IPA system DNS
records in nsupdate format in specified file and can be used with
nsupdate command to update records on an external DNS server. For more
details see this howto
<https://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/Updating_FreeIPA_system_DNS_records_on_a_remote_DNS_server>

-  <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6585>

.. _known_issues:

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  CLI doesn't work after *ipa-restore*
   <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6748>
-  AD Trust doesn't work with enabled FIPS mode
   <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6697>
-  *cert-find* does not find all certificates without sizelimit=0
   <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6716>

.. _bug_fixes:

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Contains all bugfixes and enhacements of `4.4.1 <Releases/4.4.1>`__,
`4.4.2 <Releases/4.4.2>`__, `4.4.3 <Releases/4.4.3>`__ releases

.. _installers_refactoring:

Installers Refactoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installers code base has been migrated into modules and many code
duplication has been removed.

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Installers_refactoring>

.. _normal_group_has_been_renamed_to_non_posix_in_webui:

"Normal" group has been renamed to "Non-POSIX" in WebUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the web UI, the group type label "Normal" has been changed to
"Non-POSIX" to be compatible with CLI options. The semantics of group
types is unchanged.

-  <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6334>

.. _build_system_refactoring:

Build System Refactoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several improvements of FreeIPA build system have been done. In case you
are package maintainer please read the following design document.

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Build_system_refactoring>

.. _ldap_connection_management_refactoring:

LDAP Connection Management Refactoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LDAP connection management has been standardized across FreeIPA and
should prevent LDAP connection issues during installation and upgrades
in future.

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/LDAP_Connection_Management_Refactoring>

.. _do_not_fail_when_ipa_server_has_shortname_first_in_etchosts:

Do not fail when IPA server has shortname first in /etc/hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kerberos client library is now instructed to not attempt to canonicalize
hostnames when issuing TGS requests. This improves security by avoiding
DNS lookups during canonicalization and also improves robustness of
service principal lookups in more complex DNS environments (clouds,
containerized applications). Due to this change in behavior, care must
be taken to specify correct FQDN in host/service principals as no
attempt to resolve e.g. short names will be made.

-  <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/6584>

.. _replica_connection_check_improvements:

Replica Connection Check Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improved connection check reduces possibility of failure in further
installation steps. Now ports on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
checked (if available).

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Replica_Conncheck>

.. _replace_nss_with_openssl:

Replace NSS with OpenSSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should reduce number of issues related to HTTPS connections. This change
was also needed to support FIPS.

-  <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Replace_NSS_with_OpenSSL>

.. _fully_customisable_ca_name:

Fully customisable CA name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CA subject name is now fully customisable, and is no longer required
to be related to the certificate subject base. The *ipa-server-instal*
and *ipa-ca-install* commands learned the *--ca-subject* and
*--subject-base* options for configuring these values.

-  <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/2614>
