ConfiguringLinuxClients
=======================

Can anyone tell me why we're suggesting that RHEL 2.1 be configured
differently than 3, 4, and 5 should be?

I don't know why there is a separate page for 2.1. I know it's old; some
of these pages have been here since very early in IPA devel history.
afaik the only reason for separate pages/sections is due to the
availability or not of setup scripts. Where these are lacking, manual
config is required. `DavidOBrien <User:DavidOBrien>`__ 19:18, 9 March
