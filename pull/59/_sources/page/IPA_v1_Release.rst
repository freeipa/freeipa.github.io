IPA v1 Release
==============

**Date**: April 2008

**Overview**: User identity management and centralized authentication
for Unix/Linux world

`Requirements Doc <http://www.freeipa.org/page/V1PRD>`__

**Components**:

-  Linux Distribution (Fedora / Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS)
-  389 Directory Server
-  MIT Kerberos
-  NTP
-  Tools for installation
-  Administrative tools (web and command-line)

**Main use cases to be solved**

-  Authenticate user to Linux/Unix using Kerberos/LDAP instead of NIS.
-  Set up Directory/Kerberos enviroment easily
-  Manage Linux/Unix user identity centrally and more easily (GUI)
-  Enable basic synch with AD and roadmap to a more robust synch

**Compelling reason to use**

-  Compliance is forcing organizations off of NIS
-  Efficiency is forcing organizations to a better identity management
   solution
-  Too expensive to maintain an LDAP/Kerberos implementation themselves
