The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v4.0.2!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The
builds will be available for Fedora 21. Builds for Fedora 20 are
available in the official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/mkosek/freeipa/>`__.



Highlights in 4.0.2
-------------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  TOTP watermark support was added. The last token interval is now
   being added to database and replicated in FreeIPA realm. Note that
   the number of writes is kept the same as an unnecessary LDAP write
   was eliminated.
-  Effective Attributes widget in the Add Permission Web UI page was
   improved
-  ipa-csreplica-manage can now set CA renewal master
-  trust-add is now capable of ensuring conditions for a
   `Trust <Trusts>`__ are met prior to establishing it in complex
   environments (e.g. only adding trust via AD DC with a PDC role in a
   forest root domain, falling back when no closest AD DC is available
   for the local site)



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Server installation with certificates signed by external CA could
   crash with IndexError
-  ipa-client-install could add duplicate "sss" to /etc/nsswitch.conf
   when configuring sudo
-  ipa-client-install crashed when non-zero minSSF was set on FreeIPA
   server
-  Installers and helper tools now communicate with certmonger via its
   DBUS API instead of manipulating its configuration files, fixing the
   related intermittent uninstallation failures
-  idrange-\* commands no longer allow unsupported range types
   (ipa-ad-winsync, ipa-ipa-trust)
-  user-add no longer fails when --user-auth-type is specified
-  Entries in Schema Compatibility tree are now accessible anonymously
   by default to aid legacy clients.



Known Issues
------------

-  The Directory Server may crash during install due to `389-ds bug
   47889 <https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/47889>`__.
-  Enumeration in SSSD may fail due to `389-ds bug
   47885 <https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/47885>`__.
-  Zone removal may misbehave due to a *bind-dyndb-ldap* bug. If FreeIPA
   is used to manage DNS root zones, bind-dyndb-ldap 5.1 or higher is
   recommended. Bind-dyndb-ldap 5.2 was built for Fedora
   `20 <http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/mkosek/freeipa/build/31135/>`__,
   `21 <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/bind-dyndb-ldap-5.2-1.fc21>`__,
   `rawhide <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=575841>`__.

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

| ``# ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade``
| ``# ipa-upgradeconfig``

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 3.3.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.

mailing list (http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-users) or
