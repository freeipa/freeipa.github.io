The Web UI Component
====================

Web UI is a web application for administration of FreeIPA. It has almost
the same capabilities as the 'ipa' command line utility (CLI) therefore
administrators can freely choose between them for performing common
tasks. It is built as a JavaScript `single page
application <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application>`__.
For performing its task it utilizes JSON-RPC interface to access
FreeIPA's API. This approach ensures that data which are available or
changes which can be performed are limited to the security context of
LDAP object (user) which is mapped to an active session.

Web UI has two operation modes:

-  self-service

   -  used for regular users
   -  limited interface - only information about users
   -  default page: user's profile
   -  use cases: change or view own information and reset password

-  administration

   -  used for members of 'admins' group and users with a role assigned
   -  complete interface available



Access point
------------

Web UI's URL is https://test.example.com/ipa/ui/ where
*test.example.com* is FreeIPA server's host name. Usually user can just
write a hostname because http redirects are applied in default
installation.

Login
-----

Web UI needs an active session with authenticated user in order to work.
When no or expired session is available Web UI automatically tries to
re-login. First it uses Kerberos authentication. A session is establish
and previously failed command is issued on success. An unauthorized
dialog is displayed on failure. In such case user may try to re-login
(ie. after he obtained a valid Kerberos ticket) or he can use
forms-based authentication.



Password reset when expired
---------------------------

FreeIPA 3.0 introduced password reset functionality for expired password
upon login in Web UI. Password reset form is automatically provided when
logging in using expired password and forms-based authentication. Other
option is to use */ipa/ui/password_reset.html* special page.



Special pages
-------------

Besides the main application, UI contains several more single purpose
pages.

-  */ipa/ui/password_reset.html* - Standalone password reset page
-  */ipa/ui/login.html* - Standalone login page
-  */ipa/ui/logout.html* - Dropzone on logout (destroying a session)
   from main application
-  */ipa/config/unauthorized.html* - Error page saying that user doesn't
   have a valid session. Provides links for browser configuration pages.
-  */ipa/config/browserconfig.html* - Page for automatic configuration
   of Firefox browser
-  */ipa/config/ssbrowser.html* - Page with configuration information
   for other browsers
-  */ipa/migration/* - Page for completion of user migration
