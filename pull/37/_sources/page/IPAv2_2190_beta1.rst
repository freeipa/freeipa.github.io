IPAv2_2190_beta1
================

\__NOTOC_\_

The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version 2.1.90 beta 1.This will
eventually become FreeIPA v2.2.0.

It can be downloaded from `Downloads <Downloads>`__ or from our
development repo (http://freeipa.org/downloads/freeipa-devel.repo).
Fedora 16 and 17 builds are available.

Builds for Fedora 15 are no longer being provided. Packages that FreeIPA
requires are not available in Fedora 15.



Highlights in 2.1.90 beta 1
---------------------------

-  Forms-based login. If Kerberos negotiate authentication fails you
   have the option of logging in using a form using username and
   password. Or you can go directly to /ipa/ui/login.html if you do not
   have/cannot get a Kerberos ticket. This is the preferred alternative
   login mechanism over enabling KrbMethodK5Passwd.
-  Logout from the UI
-  Support for SSH known-hosts with sssd 1.8.0. This will create a
   known-hosts file dynamically based on information stored in IPA.
-  DNS forwarders now configurable via IPA
-  Configurable by DNS zone: query policy, transfer policy, forward and
   reverse synchronization and forward policy.
-  More consistent hostname validation
-  Recommendation that the compat plugin be disabled during migration
   (unnecessary overhead)
-  On new installations the default users group, ipausers, is now
   non-POSIX

Upgrading
---------

We tested upgrades from 2.1.4 successfully but this is beta code. We do
not recommend upgrading a production server.

Installing updated rpms is all that is required to upgrade from 2.1.4.

It is unlikely that downgrading to a previous release once 2.1.90 is
installed will work.

Upgrading directly from the alpha may work but is untested.
