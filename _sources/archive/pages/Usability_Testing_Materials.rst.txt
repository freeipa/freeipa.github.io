Overview
========

| In late January 2009 the IPA team conducted a two-day usability
  testing with a group of the IT professionals from one company. The
  idea behind this testing was to check how the concepts and screens
  that represent those concepts resonate with the administrators that
  would use the IPA system to manage users, groups, access rules and
  policies. We developed 8 scenarios that cover different aspects of the
  system. For each scenario we created a document that contained concept
  explanation (if needed), task and then follow up questions. We created
  printouts of the proposed screens. The tester was presented with the
  first screen and then, as he was executing the task, he was given
  other printouts one by one. If he deviated from the expected sequence
  we stopped the test and started asking questions about why the tester
  decided to click in the area he clicked. The results of the tests can
  be found on a separate page `Usability Testing
  Results <Usability_Testing_Results>`__.
| On this page we have pointers to the materials that we used during the
  testing. You are welcome to try the test yourself!
| We got a lot of interesting and sometimes eye opening feedback so we
  are definitely planing a lot of changes. Your suggestions would also
  be very helpful.
