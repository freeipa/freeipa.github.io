The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA v4.3.0 release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The
builds are available for Fedora rawhide. Builds for Fedora 23 are
available in the official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/mkosek/freeipa-4.3/>`__.

.. _highlights_in_4.3.0:

Highlights in 4.3.0
-------------------

-  Simplified management of replication topology - control and display
   your topology from CLI and UI (`design
   page <V4/Manage_replication_topology>`__)
-  Simplified replica installation - install replica without *replica
   package* via OTP, keytab or privileged user credentials. The new
   method is called *replica promotion* as it adds FreeIPA server
   capability to existing or new client (`design
   page <V4/Replica_Promotion>`__)

.. _domain_level:

Domain Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both feature sets are tight with introduction of new "server capability
indicator" - a *domain level* (`design page <V4/Domain_Levels>`__).
Domain level indicates that server is capable of doing certain
operations. Domain level 1 means that it supports replica promotion and
topology management.

Old servers and servers upgraded to 4.3 in existing environments have
domain level 0. In order to use new functionality all servers needs to
be updated to a version which supports the domain level, right now it is
only version 4.3. Domain level is raised by command:

::

   ipa domainlevel-set 1

Current domain can be obtained by:

::

   ipa domainlevel-get

Or supported levels of individual FreeIPA servers:

::

   ipa server-show $HOSTNAME

.. _replica_installation:

Replica installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _old_method___domain_level_0:

Old method - domain level 0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior FreeIPA 4.3 replica installation needed to perform actions on both
master and future replica.

First step on master:

::

   ipa-replica-prepare $REPLICA_HOSTNAME --ip-address $REPLICA_IP

It created a replica file - an encrypted file containing secrets and
other data needed for replica installation.

Second step on replica:

::

   ipa-replica-install --various-options $REPLICA_FILE

Disadvantage is that both ``ipa-replica-prepared`` and
``ipa-replica-install`` need directory manager password and that copying
of the replica file is cumbersome.

Old method is still available for environments with domain level 0.

.. _new_method___domain_level_1:

New method - domain level 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New method transforms an IPA client into an IPA server. I.e., an IPA
client can be installed first and then it can be "promoted" into an
FreeIPA server - a new replica. Alternatively, replica installer can
also install the client so it can be done in a single operation. New
method doesn't require to run ``ipa-replica-prepare`` and manipulate
with replica file. There are multiple ways to install new replica:

.. _promotion_of_existing_client:

1. Promotion of existing client
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On client which will become new FreeIPA server:

::

   $ kinit admin
   $ ipa-replica-install [--various-options, ...]

.. _installation_of_replica_on_non_freeipa_client_machine:

2. Installation of replica on non-FreeIPA client machine
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

::

   $ ipa-replica-install --principal admin -W [--various-options, ...]

It will ask for admin password, install a client and then promote it to
replica. It will use DNS auto-discovery to locate the master server.
Alternatively the same discovery options as for ``ipa-client-install``
can be provided: ``--server``, ``--domain``, ``--realm``.

.. _installation_of_replica_using_one_time_passwordotp:

3. Installation of replica using one time password(OTP)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On any host with ``ipa`` command line utility available first prepare
the host entry with One Time Password set and assign it to
``ipaservers`` hostgroup to mark it as future IPA server.

::

   $ kinit admin
   $ ipa host-add $REPLICA_HOSTNAME --password $OTP
   $ ipa hostgroup-add-member ipaservers --hosts=$REPLICA_HOSTNAME

On future replica:

::

   $ ipa-replica-install --password $OTP [--various-options, ...]

.. _installation_of_replica_using_a_host_keytab:

4. Installation of replica using a host keytab
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Steps are similar as in installation with OTP:

On arbitrary FreeIPA client or server:

::

   $ kinit admin
   $ ipa host-add $REPLICA_HOSTNAME
   $ ipa hostgroup-add-member ipaservers --hosts=$REPLICA_HOSTNAME
   $ ipa-getkeytab --server=$IPASERVER_HOSTNAME --principal=host/$REPLICA_HOSTNAME@$REALM --keytab=replica_host.keytab
   $ # copy the replica_host.keytab  to a replica on $REPLICA_KEYTAB_PATH (arbitrary)

On future replica:

::

   $ ipa-replica-install --keytab  $REPLICA_KEYTAB_PATH [--various-options, ...]

.. _managed_replication_topology:

Managed Replication Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeIPA is a multi-master technology. Data changes on a server are
replicated automatically to all other servers. Data is stored in
Directory Server server in two so-called suffixes: a ``domain`` suffix,
e.g., ``dc=example,dc=com`` which contains all domain related
data(users, groups, hbac and sudo rules, ...) and, if the setup has CA,
a ``ca`` suffix(``o=ipaca``) which contains Certificate Server data. IPA
servers, in general, are not connected with all other servers, but
usually with only a few. It means the data is gradually propagated. The
way is defined in Directory Server by so-called replication agreements.
Replication agreements for each suffix need to be managed separately.
Recommended maximum number of agreements on one server is 4 for each
suffix. It is required to manage the topology of replication agreements
correctly so a failure of one server would not disconnect the entire
topology.

FreeIPA 4.2 and older manages the agreements using
``ipa-replica-manage`` and ``ipa-csreplica-manage`` tools. The
disadvantage of the tools are:

-  No single single server has data about the whole topology.
-  The tools needs to be run on an IPA server -> not possible in CLI or
   Web UI.
-  The lack of information prevents of proper disconnection checks,
   e.g., when a replica or a connection is removed.

FreeIPA 4.3 introduces a managed topology. The topology is maintained as
data and is replicated to all other servers. It is represented by two
new IPA object types: topology suffixes and topology segments. Topology
suffix represents a Directory Server suffix mentioned above. Topology
segment represents replication agreements between 2 servers. See
``ipa help topology`` for more information about CLI commands. IPA
servers changes their replication agreements automatically according to
this configuration. It brings following benefits:

-  ``ipa`` command line interface and Web UI(located under "IPA
   Server/Topology" menu item) can be used to manage the topology from
   any place
-  Modification of the topology performs a check to prevent
   disconnection (a server or a group of servers would not be connected
   with rest of the topology).
-  Uninstallation of replica using ``ipa-replica-manage del`` and
   ``ipa-server-install --uninstall`` tools checks if the uninstallation
   would disconnect the topology and refuses to do so.
-  Existing topology can be checked for errors using a new
   ``ipa topologysuffix-verify`` command.
-  Web UI comes with new topology graph which visualizes the topology
   and allows interactive changes of the topology.
-  It will allow to monitor state of replication in a future.

On domain level 1, managing of IPA replication agreements using
``ipa-replica-manage`` and ``ipa-csreplica-manage`` tools is no longer
possible. But the tools can be still used for managing of winsync
agreements, DNA ranges, RUVs and for reinitializing and
force-synchronizing of replicas. Long term goal is to completely replace
``ipa-csreplica-manage`` and leave ``ipa-replica-manage`` only for
managing of winsync agreements.

.. _dns_zone_creation_checks:

DNS zone creation checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeIPA now checks if specified DNS domains exist prior installing the
integrated DNS server and refuses to use DNS domain names which are
already served by other DNS servers. This prevents problems caused by
situation where multiple DNS servers wrongy act as authoritative servers
for single DNS domain. This has multiple consequences:

-  To avoid conflicts, the unattended installation creates reverse zones
   only if option ``--auto-reverse`` is used.
-  Reverse DNS zones which already exist on some other DNS servers are
   not automatically created to avoid conflicts (even during interactive
   installation).
-  When reverse zones are not managed by FreeIPA DNS, the automatic
   empty zones (as specified in `RFC
   6303 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6303#section-4>`__) are
   automatically created by BIND. In situations where these reverse
   zones are used and managed by other DNS servers, FreeIPA DNS servers
   should forward queries for these zones. In that case users must
   manually create 'forward zone' using ``ipa dnsforwarzone-add``
   command to override automatic empty zone supplied by BIND. This
   change affects only new installations.

.. _known_issues:

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Running ``ipa-dns-install`` when some other IPA server has DNS
   installed will fail. Use ``--force`` option to workaround the issue.
-  FreeIPA 4.3 requires an update of SELinux policy, see `bug
   1289930 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1289930>`__. To
   workaround the issue, disable SELinux - ``setenforce 0`` - on master
   when installing a replica or a Certificate Server.
-  Re-installation of replica with CA or re-installation of KRA will
   fail without
   `pki-core-10.2.6-13 <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-c7dd78ac78>`__,
   see `bug #1704 <https://fedorahosted.org/pki/ticket/1704>`__
