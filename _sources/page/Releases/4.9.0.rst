The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA 4.9.0 release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Builds
for Fedora distributions will be available from the official repository
soon.



Highlights in 4.9.0
-------------------

-  298: [RFE] Add support for cracklib to password policies

      FreeIPA password quality checking plugin has been extended to use
      libpwquality library. Password policies can now check for a reuse
      of a user name, dictionary words using a cracklib package, numbers
      and symbols replacement and repeating characters in the passwords.

--------------

-  2445: [RFE] IdM password policy should include checks for repeating
   characters

      FreeIPA password quality checking plugin has been extended to use
      libpwquality library. Password policies can now check for a reuse
      of a user name, dictionary words using a cracklib package, numbers
      and symbols replacement and repeating characters in the passwords.

--------------

-  3299: [RFE] Switch the client to JSON RPC

      Clients now communicate with FreeIPA server via JSON-RPC instead
      of XML-RPC by default. The new interface for example allows
      sending additional information (notices, warnings) when a
      management operation ends with an error.

--------------

-  3687: [RFE] IPA user account expiry warning.

      EPN stands for Expiring Password Notification. It is a standalone
      tool designed to build a list of users whose password would expire
      in the near future, and either display the list in a
      machine-readable (JSON) format, or send email notifications to
      these users. EPN provides command-line options to display the list
      of affected users. This provides data introspection and helps
      understand how many emails would be sent for a given day, or a
      given date range. The command-line options can also be used by a
      monitoring system to alert whenever a number of emails over the
      SMTP quota would be sent. EPN is meant to be launched once a day
      from an IPA client (preferred) or replica from a systemd timer.
      EPN does not keep state: the list of affected users is built at
      runtime but never kept.

--------------

-  3827: [RFE] Expose TTL in web UI

      DNS record time to live (TTL) parameters can be edited in Web UI

--------------

-  3999: [RFE] Fix and Document how to set up Samba File Server with IPA

      Samba file server can now be configured on the FreeIPA-enrolled
      system to provide file services to users in IPA domain and to
      users from trusted Active Directory forests

--------------

-  4751: Implement ACME certificate enrolment

      Configure the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
      protocol support provided by the dogtag CA.

--------------

-  5011: [RFE] Forward CA requests to dogtag or helper by GSSAPI

--------------

-  5608: [RFE] Add Dogtag configuration extensions

--------------

-  5662: ID Views: do not allow custom Views for the masters

      Custom ID views cannot be applied to IPA masters. A check was
      added to both IPA CLI and Web UI to prevent applying custom ID
      views to avoid confusion and unintended side-effects.

--------------

-  5948: [RFE] Implement pam_pwquality featureset in IPA password
   policies

--------------

-  6783: [RFE] Host-group names command rename

      host groups can now be renamed with IPA CLI: 'ipa hostgroup-mod
      group-name --rename new-name'. Protected hostgroups ('ipaservers')
      cannot be renamed.

--------------

-  7137: [RFE]: Able to browse different links from IPA web gui in new
   tabs

--------------

-  7181: ipa-replica-prepare fails for 2nd replica when passwordHistory
   is enabled

      FreeIPA password policy plugin in 389-ds was extended to exempt
      non-Kerberos LDAP objects from checking Kerberos policy during
      password changes by the Directory Manager or a password
      synchronization manager. This issue affected, among others, an
      integrated CA administrator account during deployment of more than
      one replica in some cases.

--------------

-  7522: Disable cert publishing in dogtag

      Dogtag certificate publishing facility is not configured anymore
      as it is not used in FreeIPA.

--------------

-  7577: [RFE] DNS package check should be called earlier in
   installation routine

      The \``--setup-dns`\` knob and interactive installer now both
      check for the presence of freeipa-server-dns early and abort the
      installer with an error before starting actual deployment.

--------------

-  7695: ipa service-del should display principal name instead of
   Invalid 'principal'.

      When deleting services, report exact name of a system required
      principal that couldn't be deleted.

--------------

-  7966: Add support for JSON-RPC in ipa-join

      ipa-join tool defaults to use of JSON-RPC protocol when
      communicating to IPA masters by default. The choice of JSON-RPC or
      XML-RPC is a compile-time setting now.

--------------

-  7971: [RFE] Include hint for replication_wait_timeout if timeout
   fails

--------------

-  8106: ca-certificate file not being parsed correctly on Ubuntu with
   p11-kit-trust.so due to data inserted by FreeIPA Client install

      On Debian-based platforms update-ca-certificates does not support
      multiple certificates in a single file. IPA installers now write
      individual files per each certificate for Debian-based platforms.

--------------

-  8114: [RFE] Delegate group membership management

      It is now possible to associate group managers with the groups.
      Group managers have rights to add and remove members of the
      individual group rather than being administrators for every group.

--------------

-  8129: Tests: Replace paramiko with OpenSSH

      Paramiko is not compatible with FIPS mode, therefore convert most
      tests to using ssh directly. The only non-converted test is the
      2-prompt OTP test because sshpass does not support 2-prompt
      password authentication ( https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/8431 ).

--------------

-  8151: test_commands timing-out

      Re-enable test_sss_ssh_authorizedkeys ; add -v to ssh in order to
      get debug information if this test fails or stalls again. The test
      was run 16 times without a failure before re-enabling it.

--------------

-  8189: NIghtly test failure in
   test_integration/test_nfs.py::TestIpaClientAutomountFileRestore::test_nsswitch_backup_restore_sssd

      Previously, ipa-client-installation saved the pre-install state
      using "authselect current" command and the uninstallation reverted
      to the same authselect state. In cases where the system was
      installed using authconfig instead of authselect, the
      uninstallation was unable to revert to the same state and picked
      "sssd"'s authselect profile instead. Now, the client installation
      relies on the backup functionality of authselect and is able to
      revert to the exact pre-install state

--------------

-  8217: RFE: ipa-backup should compare locally and globally installed
   server roles

      ipa-backup now checks whether the local replica's roles match
      those used in the cluster and exits with a warning if this is not
      the case as backups taken on this host would not be sufficient for
      a proper restore. FreeIPA administrators are advised to double
      check whether the host backups are run has all the necessary
      (used) roles.

--------------

-  8222: Upgrade dojo.js

      Version of dojo.js framework used by FreeIPA Web UI was upgraded
      to 1.16.2.

--------------

-  8233: 4.8.5 master Installation error

      On Debian and ALT Linux setup of AJP connector did restart Apache
      instance before it was configured. The restart wasn't actually
      needed and thus was removed.

--------------

-  8236: Enforce a check to prevent adding objects from IPA as external
   members of external groups

      Command 'ipa group-add-member' allowed to specify any user or
      group for '--external' option. A stricter check is added to verify
      that a group or user to be added as an external member does not
      come from IPA domain.

--------------

-  8239: Actualize Bootstrap version

      Bootstrap Javascript framework used by FreeIPA web UI was updated
      to version 3.4.1.

--------------

-  8241: Build fails on Fedora 30

      SELinux rules for ipa-custodia were merged into FreeIPA SELinux
      policy. The policy relied on an SELinux interface that is not
      available in Fedora 30. The logic was changed to allow better
      portability across SELinux versions.

--------------

-  8268: Prevent use of too long passwords

      Kerberos tools limit password entered in kpasswd or kadmin tools
      to 1024 characters but do not allow to distinguish between
      passwords cut off at 1024 characters and passwords with 1024
      characters. Thus, a limit of 1000 characters is now applied
      everywhere in FreeIPA.

--------------

-  8275: Support systemd-resolved

      FreeIPA DNS servers now detect systemd-resolved and configure it
      to pass through itself.

--------------

-  8276: Add default password policy for sysaccounts

      cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc now has a default password policy to permit
      system accounts with krbPrincipalAux object class. This allows
      system accounts to have a keytab that does not expire. The
      "Default System Accounts Password Policy" has a minimum password
      length in case the password is directly modified with LDAP.

--------------

-  8284: Upgrade jQuery version to actual one

      Version of jQuery framework used by FreeIPA Web UI was updated to
      3.4.1.

--------------

-  8289: ipa servicedelegationtarget-add-member does not allow to add
   hosts as targets

      service delegation rules and targets now allow to specify hosts as
      a rule or a target's member principal.

--------------

-  8291: krb5kdc crashes in IPA plugin on use of IPA Windows principal
   alias

      Memory handling in various FreeIPA KDC functions was improved,
      preventing potential crashes when looking up machine account
      aliases for Windows machines.

--------------

-  8301: The value of the first character in target\* keywords is
   expected to be a double quote

      389-ds 1.4 enforces syntax for target\* keywords (targetattr,
      targetfilter, etc) to have quoted attributes. Otherwise the aci
      that contains unquoted parameters is ignored. Default FreeIPA
      access controls were fixed to follow 389-ds syntax. Any
      third-party ACIs need to be updated manually.

--------------

-  8304: [fed32] client-install does not properly set
   ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes in sshd conf

      ipa-client-installation now writes the sshd configuration to the
      drop-in directory /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/, in the 04-ipa.conf
      snippet, thus ensuring that the setting
      "ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes" take precedence.

--------------

-  8315: [dirsrv] set 'nsslapd-enable-upgrade-hash: off' as this raises
   warnings

      389-ds 1.4.1.6 introduced automatic password hash upgrade on LDAP
      binds. FreeIPA now disables this feature because changing password
      hash in FreeIPA is not allowed by the internal plugins that
      synchronize password hashes between LDAP and Kerberos.

--------------

-  8322: [RFE] Changing default hostgroup is too easy

      In Web UI a confirmation dialog was added to automember
      configuration to prevent unintended modification of a default host
      group.

--------------

-  8325: [WebUI] Fix htmlPrefilter issue in jQuery

      CVE-2020-11022: In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2
      and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after
      sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e.
      .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.
      FreeIPA is not allowing to pass arbitrary code into affected
      jQuery path but we applied jQuery fix anyway.

--------------

-  8335: [WebUI] manage IPA resources as a user from a trusted Active
   Directory domain

      When users from trusted Active Directory domains have permissions
      to manage IPA resources, they can do so through a Web UI
      management console.

--------------

-  8348: Allow managed permissions with ldap:///self bind rule

      Managed permissions can now address self-service operations. This
      makes possible for 3rd-party plugins to supply full set of managed
      permissions.

--------------

-  8357: Allow managing IPA resources as a user from a trusted Active
   Directory forest

      A 3rd-party plugin to provide management of IPA resources as users
      from trusted Active Directory domains was merged into FreeIPA
      core. ID user overrides can now be added to IPA management groups
      and roles and thus allow AD users to manage IPA.

--------------

-  8362: IPA: Ldap authentication failure due to Kerberos principal
   expiration UTC timestamp

      LDAP authentication now handles Kerberos principal and password
      expiration time in UTC time zone. Previously, a local server time
      zone was applied even though UTC was implied in the settings.

--------------

-  8374: EPN does not ship its default configuration ( /etc/ipa/epn.conf
   ) in freeipa-client-epn

      EPN did not ship any configuration file. This was an oversight,
      but the tool itself would work fine as it had sane defaults ;
      moreover, the man page for the configuration file was present.

--------------

-  8391: Remove dnf workaround from test_epn.y

      The new PR-CI images are cleaner and do not need the \*epn\*
      packages to be uninstalled/reinstalled.

--------------

-  8401: Create platform definitions for freeipa-container

      ipaplatform now provides container platform flavors for
      freeipa/freeipa-container

--------------

-  8404: Detect and fail if not enough memory is available for
   installation

      FreeIPA server now requires at least 1.2 GiB RAM for installation
      to prevent performance degradation.

--------------

-  8432: test failure in
   test_commands.py::TestIPACommand::test_login_wrong_password:
   AssertionError

      Sometimes test_login_wrong_password fails because the log window
      the string message is searched in is too narrow. Broaden the
      window by looking at the past 10 seconds.

--------------

-  8444: EPN: enhance input validation

      Various input validation checks were added to EPN.

--------------

-  8445: EPN: '[Errno 111] Connection refused' when the SMTP is down

      EPN now displays a proper message if the configured SMTP server
      cannot be contacted.

--------------

-  8449: EPN: enhance CLI option tests

      EPN: enhance existing tests for --dry-run, --from-nbdays and
      --to-nbdays.

--------------

-  8488: SELinux blocks custodia key replication / retrieval for sub-CAs

      SELinux: Make sure ipa_custodia_t has the necessary rights ; add
      dedicated policy rules for ipa-pki-retrieve-key.

--------------

-  8490: It is not possible to edit KDC database when the FreeIPA server
   is running

      kadmin.local command 'getprincs' is now supported

--------------

-  8493: Synchronize index LDIF and index update files

      Configuration of LDAP indices was moved into a single place. New
      indices were added to attributes related to trusted domains
      operations. Performance improvement is expected for Kerberos
      service tickets requested by users from trusted Active Directory
      domains.

--------------

-  8503: pkispawn logs files are empty

      On recent versions of Dogtag PKI, pkispawn does not create logs by
      default, making debugging failed IPA installs impossible. Invoke
      pkispawn with --debug to revert to the previous behavior.

--------------

-  8507: [WebUI] Backport jQuery patches from newer versions of the
   library (e.g. 3.5.0)

      Support reproducible builds for jQuery library

--------------

-  8510: create_active_user and kinit_as_user should collect
   kdcinfo.REALM on failure

      Sometimes, requesting a TGT after a password reset fails because
      SSSD seems to select different hosts for these two sequential
      tasks, leaving no time for replication to replicate the password
      hashes. Add debug information to the test suites that exhibit the
      problem and always display the kdcinfo file maintained by SSSD
      that contains the KRB5KDC IP it should be pinned to.

--------------

-  8530: Running ipa-server-install fails on machine where libsss_sudo
   is not installed

      The FreeIPA client RPM now has a soft dependency on libsss_sudo
      and sudo itself.

--------------

-  8536: RFE: ipatests: run healthcheck on hidden replica

      ipatests: freeipa-healthcheck is now executed on each member of a
      cluster that contains a hidden replica.

--------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Known Issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  8240: KRA install fails if all KRA members are Hidden Replicas

      If the first KRA instance is installed on a hidden replica, more
      KRA instances cannot be added to the cluster. As a workaround,
      temporarily make the the hidden replica with the KRA role visible
      before adding more KRA instances. The previously-hidden replica
      can be hidden again as soon as ipa-kra-install is complete.

--------------
