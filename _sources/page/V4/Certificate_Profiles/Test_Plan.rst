Complex test cases - notes
==========================

1. test the store option. To do this, issue a certificate.

::

       1.1 store=true
       1.2 store=false

how does this work?

2. Disable/enable of an ACL

::

       2.1 Enabled ACL for a particular profile
       2.2 Disabled ACL

3. Issue certificate with a custom profile (s-mime)

::

       3.1 Make sure the certificate is issued
       3.2 Check the certificate extensions against the CSR
    

4. Update an existing profile

::

       4.1 Update a profile with new data
       4.2 Sign a certificate with the profile. Make sure it doesn't fail.
       4.3 Check if the generated certificate matches constraints set by the updated profile.
