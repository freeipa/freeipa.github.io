The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version FreeIPA v3.0.2.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads.



Highlights in 3.0.2
-------------------

-  WebUI: Change of default value of type of new group back to POSIX.
-  Lookup the user SID in external group as well.
-  Include sssd-managed domain/realm mapping file managed in krb5.conf.
-  Fix potential security error in cookie handling in ipa client tool,
   CVE-2012-5631.

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 is supported. Upgrading from previous versions is
not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
