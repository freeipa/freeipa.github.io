IPAv2_2190_alpha2
=================

\__NOTOC_\_ The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version 2.1.90 alpha
2. This will eventually become FreeIPA v2.2.0.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/Downloads or from our
development repo (http://freeipa.org/downloads/freeipa-devel.repo).
Fedora 15, 16 and 17 builds are available.

For Fedora 17 users the the required version of 389-ds-base has not been
pushed to updates-testing yet. You can retrieve it manually from
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=299543 or download
the packages with:

``# koji download-build 299543``

Alpha 1 was an unannounced release that formed the basis of the first
Fedora 17 package. It was not well-tested, particularly for upgrades,
which is why it wasn't announced at the time. It was released to meet
Fedora 17 package deadlines.



Highlights in 2.1.90 alpha 2
----------------------------

-  A new KDC LDAP backend, ipa-kdb. This simplifies our set up code and
   will is a big piece of future MS PAC support. It also removes the
   need for the separate ipa_kpasswd daemon, kadmind is used instead.
-  Support for storing SSH user and host public keys.
-  SELinux user map rules. These let you set the SELinux context for
   users in an HBAC rule.
-  Improved DNS UI and command-line with vastly improved argument
   handling.
-  UI screens for Automember were added.
-  Session support in the Web UI. This removes the need to do Kerberos
   negotiation with every request significantly improving Web UI
   performance.
-  Support for S4U2Proxy. This is a Kerberos feature which allows a
   delegated service (HTTP in our case) to request a ticket (ldap) on a
   user's behalf. We no longer require the TGT to be delegated to the
   server. A forwardable TGT is still required.
-  Improved command-line performance. It is approximately 50% faster.
-  MAC address has been added to hosts.

Upgrading
---------

We tested upgrades from 2.1.4 successfully but this is alpha code. We do
not recommend upgrading a production server.

Installing updated rpms is all that is required to upgrade from 2.1.4.

It is unlikely that downgrading to a previous release once 2.1.90 is
installed will work.

Feedback
--------

Please provide comments, bugs and other feedback via the freeipa-devel
mailing list: http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-devel
