NTP_Servers_Configuration
=========================

Overview
--------

Currently the configuration and synchronization of the NTP service is
integrated into the FreeIPA system, so supporting a new time server or
changing/debugging the old one turns is inconvenient and time-consuming.
Besides, FreeIPA currently supports only one ntp service, it's chrony.
Yes, chrony is a modern and secure time server, but not all
distributions work with chrony like Fedora 28. However, many Linux
distributions are using the FreeIPA system, so they need to support the
new version.



Use Cases
---------

The proposed solution is to make the ntp module independent, not
integrated into the FreeIPA system, and make it support three different
time servers (chrony, ntpd, openntpd). This increases the FreeIPA
system’s flexibility in respect of adding support for new time servers
and re-configuring old ones. Also, other distributions, which supported
other ntp services, will be able to get a fresh version of the IPA
system.

Design
------

|NTP_layers_diagram.png| At the time synchronization stage, when the ipa
server/client is being installed or when the state is being restored, a
request is sent to the abstract layer which defines the type of the ntp
service installed in the system. This is done by a package manager. The
type of the package manager is defined by the type of the supported
distribution (Fedora rpm, Debian deb).

When the type of the ntp service is defined, its class, inherited from
the parent class, is being created (the lower level of the scheme). All
ntp classes work on the basis of the parent class. It contains methods
of configuration, synchronization and initial state restore. The lower
level ntp classes just redefine some of the parent class variables, the
values of which depend on the specific type of the ntp service. After
that the required ntp method is called (configuration, synchronization,
state restore). If the time synchronization is successful, a dns record
of the ntp server will be added.

All supported ntp services support the "server" and "pool" options,
values of which are written to fields specific to each ntp service when
the synchronization is being configured.

When the ntp service is being configured and synchronized, its initial
state and the state of its configuration file are saved; when the ipa
server/client is deleted, the initial state of the ntp service and its
configuration are restored.

All actions related to configuration and synchronization of the ntp
service are performed automatically; the user just needs to install a
preferred ntp daemon in the system.

Implementation
--------------

The abstract layer is represented by the ipalib/createntp.py module,
with which the ipa server/client directly communicates at the time
synchronization stage. Once the type of the ntp service is defined, the
specific ntp class is created according to the type. The ntp class is
generated from ipaserver/install/servntplib.py and
ipaclient/install/clintplib.py (for the server and for the client,
accordingly). The created ntp class is inherited from the parent class
ipaserver/install/servntpconf.py or ipaclient/install/clintpconf.py.

During the FreeIPA installation, an additional package containing
modules for the ntp service configuration and time synchronization is
installed: python-ipaserver-ntplib and python-ipaclient-ntplib (for the
client and for the server, accordingly). Additional ntp packages do not
contain dependencies on specific ntp services and their installation
will not affect the system environment; it will just enable the FreeIPA
to synchronize the time.

The user has to choose whether to install the package with the ipa ntp
modules or not. If user installed ipa ntp package, the type of the ntp
service is defined during the installation of the ipa server/client. If
no supported ntp services are found in the system and the installation
is run without the "-N" option, the user will receive a warning and the
installation will finish. If the "-N" option is present, all settings
and the time synchronization will be ignored.

The priority of choosing the ntp service is the following: chrony, ntpd,
openntpd.

CLI

As stated above, you don’t need any other settings and flags in order to
select the ntp service; the ntp module detects the time server
automatically. You need to have a distribution with an ntp daemon
(chrony, ntpd or openntpd) and an appropriate IPA ntp library. But you
can use flags to add ntp servers for synchronizing time. *Example:*

Upgrade
-------

There are no additional actions required once the FreeIPA is upgraded.



Test Plan
---------

As the creation of the ntp classes is performed via the abstraction, and
the specific ntp classes just redefine some of the parent class
variables, it is sufficient to check the work of the abstraction based
on one of the ntp services, for example:

*a fresh install with the chrony service installed in the system without
the "-N" option.*

It is also possible to check whether the ntp service settings are fully
ignored:

*a fresh install with the "-N" option.*
