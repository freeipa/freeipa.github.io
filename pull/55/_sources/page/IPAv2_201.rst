IPAv2_201
=========

\__NOTOC_\_ May 2, 2011

The FreeIPA project team is pleased to announce the availability of the
`freeIPA 2.0.1 server <http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads>`__.

It is available in Fedora 15 and Fedora rawhide.



Known Issues
------------

-  If the domain and realm do not match you may need to use the --force
   flag with ipa-client-install.
-  Dogtag replication is done separately from IPA replication. The
   ipa-replica-manage tool does not currently operate on dogtag
   replication agreements.
-  The OCSP URL encoded in dogtag certificates is by default the CA
   machine that issued the certificate.
