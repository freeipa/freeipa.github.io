The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v4.2.0 Alpha 1 release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The
builds for Fedora 22 and Fedora Rawhide will be available in the
official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/mkosek/freeipa-4.2/>`__.



Highlights in 4.2
-----------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Support for multiple certificate profiles, including support for user
   certificates. The profiles are now replicated between FreeIPA server
   to have consistent state for all certificate creation request. The
   certificate submission requests are authorized by the new CA ACL
   rules (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/57>`__,
   `design <V4/Certificate_Profiles>`__)
-  User life-cycle management management - add inactive stage users
   using UI or LDAP interface and have them moved to active users by
   single command. Deleted users can now be also moved - *preserved* -
   to special tree and re-activated when user returns, preserving it's
   UID/GID (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3813>`__,
   `design <V4/User_Life-Cycle_Management>`__)
-  Support for Password Vault (KRA) component of `PKI <PKI>`__ for
   storing user or service secrets. All encrypted with public key
   cryptography so that even FreeIPA server does not know the secrets!
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3872>`__,
   `design <V4/Password_Vault>`__,
   `implementation <V4/Password_Vault_Implementation>`__)
-  Replication topology is now managed by `Directory
   Server <Directory_Server>`__ *Topology plugin* which allows
   modifications to the topology via standard FreeIPA UI. The plugin is
   enabled for new 4.2 based deployment and for upgraded deployments
   that raised the `Domain Level <V4/Domain_Levels>`__ to 1
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4302>`__,
   `design <V4/Manage_replication_topology>`__)

-  Datepicker is now used for datetime fields in the Web UI
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4347>`__)
-  Upgrade process was overhauled. There is now single upgrade tool
   (``ipa-server-upgrade``) providing simplified interface for upgrading
   the FreeIPA server. See details in separate subsection.
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4904>`__,
   `design <V4/Server_Upgrade_Refactoring>`__)
-  Service constrained delegation rules can be now added by UI and CLI
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3644>`__,
   `design <V4/Service_Constraint_Delegation>`__)
-  FreeIPA Web Server no longer use deprecated ``mod_auth_kerb`` but
   switched to the modern ``mod_auth_gssapi``
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4190>`__)
-  Add support for Domain Levels
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/5018>`__,
   `design <V4/Domain_Levels>`__)
-  ``migrate-ds`` command can now search the migrated users and groups
   with different scope
-  DNSSEC integration was improved and FreeIPA server is configured to
   do DNSSEC validation by default. This might potentially affect
   installations which did not follow `Deployment Recommendations for
   DNS <Deployment_Recommendations#DNS>`__.



Changes to upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The server still upgrades automatically during RPM update. However,
``ipactl start`` now verifies that the server was really upgraded before
starting FreeIPA to prevent running upgraded bits on old data when
``ipa-server-upgrade`` was not run during RPM update (for example during
`FedUp <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedUp>`__ Fedora upgrade).

Update files (files in ``/usr/share/ipa/updates/``) format was changed.
Namely:

-  Updates are not merged, update files are applied one at a time
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3560>`__)
-  Update entries no longer support CSV - commas can be now freely used
   in the added attributes
-  Update can now use base64 values
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4984>`__)
-  Update plugins are now not run automatically, but when referenced
   from update files (``plugin:``)



Known Issues
------------

Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  missing dependency on ``python-setuptools``, run
   ``dnf install python-setuptools`` before installing FreeIPA rpms.



Topology management
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  ``ipa-replica-manage del`` doesn't check for disconnection of
   topology
-  replica reinitialization after ``ipa topologysegment-reinitialize``
   could be executed multiple times
   (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/5065>`__)
-  topology segment direction and 'enable' can be still modified. It
   will not be allowed in final version.

Certificates
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Certificate profiles are not correctly upgraded and therefore
   certificate signing requests fail
-  Web UI does not support multiple certificates

Upgrading
---------

Upgrade instructions are available on the `Upgrade <Upgrade>`__ page.

--------

mailing list (http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-users) or
