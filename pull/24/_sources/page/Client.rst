Client
======

FreeIPA uses standard components and protocols so any
LDAP/`Kerberos <Kerberos>`__ (and even NIS) client can interoperate with
FreeIPA `Directory Server <Directory_Server>`__ for basic authentication
and user/group enumeration. However additional management functionality
can be achieved using the `SSSD <http://fedorahosted.org/sssd>`__
project. SSSD is a spin-off of the FreeIPA project and has specific
support for FreeIPA features with the 'IPA' provider. Additional
features made available via SSSD are SUDO integration, HBAC policies,
SELinux user mapping, and more. SSSD is configured by default.

Certificates
============

When certificates are to be used on a client as well,
`Certmonger <Certmonger>`__ can handle it's automated renewal so that
they do not get out of validity range.

Compatibility
=============

FreeIPA client functionality (identity, authentication, policies) is
maintained to be both backward and forward compatible. Thus, SSSD in
FreeIPA `3.3.5 <Releases/3.3.5>`__ will be fully functional both with
FreeIPA `3.0.0 <Releases/3.0.0>`__ and FreeIPA 4.0. When connected to
the older server, it will of course only provide functionality available
on the older server.



IPA management tool
-------------------

``ipa`` management command (available in ``freeipa-admintools`` package)
and the FreeIPA API itself only maintains **forward** compatibility.
Therefore, ``ipa`` command on FreeIPA `3.0.0 <Releases/3.0.0>`__ client
will be able to control FreeIPA 4.0 but not vice versa. Additionally,
client will be able to only run commands and parameters available in the
older version. FreeIPA client of the same version as the server need to
be used to leverage full FreeIPA management capability.

Every FreeIPA client is built with given API version. When a management
command is executed, client sends it's API version together with the
command to the server. The server then compares the API version with
it's own and if the client is compatible, it executes the command. If
not, the command errors out:

::

   $ ipa user-find example
   ipa: ERROR: 2.65 client incompatible with 2.49 server at u'https://ipa.example.com/ipa/xml'

Integration
===========

FreeIPA Client integrates with many Linux native services so that
administrator can conveniently configure them centrally, on FreeIPA
server. The services mostly use SSSD so that they can also benefit from
*caching* and be available when the client is offline.

-  **automount**: server can keep *automount maps* differentiated by a
   location. The maps are consumed by client *autofs*. The integration
   is configured with a separate installation script -
   ``ipa-client-automount`` which can be run after
   ``ipa-client-install``.
-  **SSH**: server can keep SSH public keys (`training
   material <https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa.github.io/raw/main/src/page/Freeipa30_SSH_Public_Keys.odp>`__) that are than used
   by both ``sshd`` and ``ssh``. The integration is configured
   automatically with ``ipa-client-install``, unless limited with
   ``--no-ssh``/``--no-sshd``. DNS SSHFP records for the host are
   automatically created by ``ipa-client-install``, unless run with
   ``--no-dns-sshfp``.
-  **SUDO**: server can provide centralized *sudoers* to all clients
   (`training material <https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa.github.io/blob/main/src/page/Freeipa30_SSSD_SUDO_Integration.pdf>`__.
   The feature needs to be configured manually in FreeIPA clients older
   than 4.0 (`related
   ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3358>`__). Since
   FreeIPA 4.0, configuration happens automatically unless unless
   ``--no-sudo`` is passed.
-  **SELinux user map**: server can keep policies to assign different
   SELinux user roles to users, based on their group or host group (see
   `SELinux user mapping <SELinux_user_mapping>`__ article or `training
   material <https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa.github.io/blob/main/src/page/Freeipa30_SELinuxUserMap.pdf>`__). The feature is
   configure automatically with ``ipa-client-install``
