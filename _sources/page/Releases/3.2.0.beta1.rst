The FreeIPA team is proud to announce the first Beta of FreeIPA v3.2.0.
We would like to welcome any early testers of this Beta to provide us
feedback and help us stabilize this feature release which we plan to
release as final in the beginning of May 2013.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The new
version has also been built for Fedora 19 Alpha.



Highlights in 3.2.0 Beta 1
--------------------------



New features for 3.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Support installing FreeIPA without an embedded Certificate Authority,
   with user-provided SSL certificates for the HTTP and Directory
   servers. [1]
-  New cert-find command. Search certificates in the Dogtag database
   based on their serial number, validity or revocation details. This
   feature is available both as a CLI command and Web UI page. [2]
-  New trustconfig-show and trustconfig-mod command. Show or modify AD
   Trust settings generated during AD Trust installation
   (ipa-adtrust-install) [3]
-  Multiple FreeIPA servers can now be designated as Domain Controllers
   for trusts with Active Directory [12]
-  New realmdomains-show and realmdomains-mod command. Manage list of
   DNS domains associated with FreeIPA realm (realmdomains sommand).
   This list is primarily used by AD, which can pull all domains managed
   by FreeIPA and use that list for routing authentication requests for
   domains which do not match FreeIPA realm name. [4]
-  Support trusted domain users in HBAC test command (hbactest command).
-  Allow filtering incoming trusted domain SIDs per-trust (trust-mod
   command). [5]
-  Configurable PAC type for services. Service commands can now
   configure a set of PAC types (MS-PAC, PAD, no PAC) that are supported
   and handled for the service.
-  Faster UI loading. FreeIPA Web UI application is now packaged in
   minimalized format. FreeIPA web server is now also able to transmit
   data in compressed format. [6] [7]
-  UI now accepts confirmation of cancel of its dialogs via keyboard
   [11]
-  Client reenrollment. A host that has been recreated can now be
   reenrolled to FreeIPA server using a backed up host keytab or admin
   credentials [8]
-  Service and Host commands now provide options to add or remove
   selected Kerberos flags [9]
-  Full system backup and restore [13]
-  Source hosts have been completely removed from HBAC. They haven't
   been used by SSSD for quite some time and are being removed to avoid
   the suggestion that they might actually do something.
-  Updated French and Ukranian translations.



Beta 1 limitations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  List of DNS domains associated with FreeIPA realm currently only
   works with a special Samba build available for Fedora 18:

http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=5184105. One needs to
rebuild FreeIPA 3.2.0 beta 1 against this Samba version in order to get
it working.

-  Test of trusted domain users in HBAC rules is accessible to only to
   members of 'Trust Admins' group due to privilege limitations
-  Same applies to any other trust-specific operations that require
   translation between user/group name and its security identifier (SID)



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Fixed migration from OpenLDAP. FreeIPA is now able to migrate users
   and groups from OpenLDAP database instances.
-  Migration process is now also a lot faster and provides more debug
   output (to httpd error log).
-  SUDO rules disabled by sudorule-disable command are now removed from

ou=sudoers compat tree without a need to restart 389 Directory Server
instance.

-  Fixed LDAP schema upgrade when upgrading from a pre-2.2.0 release
-  Fixed server installation with external CA (--external-ca)
-  Consolidate on-line help system, show help without need of valid
   Kerberos credentials (ipa help)
-  New LDAP plugin (ipa_dns) has been added to add missing idnsSOASerial

attribute for replicas which either do not have integrated DNS service
enabled to which have disabled SOA serial autoincrement

-  LDAP lockout plugin has been fixed so that lockout policies are
   applied consistently both for LDAP binds and Kerberos authentication
-  ... and many others stabilization fixes, see Detailed changelog for
   full details



Changes in API or CLI------------------



Dropped --selfsign option
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeIPA servers prior to 3.2.0 could be installed with --selfsign
option. This configured the server with a NSS database based Certificate
Authority with a selfsigned CA certificate and limited certificate
operation support.

This option was always intended for development or testing purposes only
and was not intended for use in production. This release drops this
option and deprecates the functionality. Current FreeIPA servers
installed with --selfsigned option will still work, instructions on how
to migrate to supported certificate options will be provided.

FreeIPA servers version 3.2.0 and later supports the following 2 flavors
of certificate management:

-  FreeIPA with pki-ca (dogtag) with either a self-signed certificate or
   with a certificate signed by external CA (--external-ca option)
-  FreeIPA with no pki-ca installed with certificates signed and
   provided by an external CA [1]



Dropped CSV support
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeIPA client CLI supported CSV in some arguments so that multiple
values could be added with just one convenient option:

::

    ipa permission-add some-perm --permissions=read,write --attrs=sn,cn
    ipa dnsrecord-add example.com --a-rec=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2

CSV parsing however introduces great difficulty when trying to include a
value with an embedded space in it. Escaping these values is not
intuitive and made it very difficult to add such values. The level of
effort in working around the CSV problems has come to the point where
the benefits of it are outweighed by the problems which lead to decision
to drop CSV support in CLI altogether [10].

There are several ways to workaround lack of CSV:

Provide an argument multiple times on the command-line:

::

    ipa permission-add some-perm --permissions=read --permissions=write --attrs=sn --attrs=cn
    ipa dnsrecord-add example.com --a-rec=10.0.0.1 --a-rec=10.0.0.2

Let BASH do the expansion for you:

::

    ipa permission-add some-perm --permissions={read,write} --attrs={sn,cn}
    ipa dnsrecord-add example.com --a-rec={10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2}

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
