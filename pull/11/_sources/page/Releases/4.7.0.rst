The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA 4.7.0 release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads.



Highlights in 4.7.0
-------------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mod_ssl
^^^^^^^

IPA has switched to mod_ssl as the crypto engine for Apache. This change
will be made automatically when upgrading.



NSS sqlite database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fedora 28 changed the default database format type from dbm to sqlite.
Theoretically there should be no end-user difference but you will see
different file names for your NSS databases: cert9.db, key4.db and
pkcs11.txt.

authselect
^^^^^^^^^^

Fedora 28 switched to a new PAM configuration tool, authselect.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Authselect



Time server change to chronyd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ntpd service was deprecated in F28. It was replaced by chronyd. The
client also uses chrony as its time client.

https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/ntpd_deprecation/chronyd_support



Python 3
^^^^^^^^

FreeIPA now fully supports Python 3 and can be installed without any
python 2 dependencies.

   steps of external CA installation.

   ipa-server-install --external-ca phase, is not running when the
   second phase is run with --external-cert-file options, the
   ipa-server-install command fail.
