Summary
=======

freeIPA1.2 will focus on making IPA as useable as possible by other
projects. This will include enabling IPA to manage machine and service
identity and creating a plug-in architecture for IPA.

.. _main_use_cases_solved:

Main use cases solved
=====================

-  User Identity

   -  Same as IPAv1

-  Machine authentication and identity

   -  Identify and group machines (and virtual instances)
   -  Allow new machines to join IPA and gain an identity

.. _detailed_requirements:

Detailed Requirements
=====================

.. _machine_identity:

Machine Identity
----------------

-  [1] A newly installed machine that is running the IPA client software
   shall be able to automatically discovers the IPA server. Policy on
   that IPA server shall determine whether:

   -  [1.1] The machine shall automatically be registered in IPA and
      configured with settings that were pre initialised
   -  [1.2] An Administrator is required to manually authenticate to the
      IPA server and initialise the configuration settings

-  [2] Upon join a unique and permanent identifier (machine guid) shall
   be set for each machine and virtual machine.

   -  [2.1] Assign a kerberos principal to the machine/vm.
   -  [2.2] Kerberos machine/vm principal name will be administrator
      assigned or automatically set
   -  [2.3] Kerberos machine/vm principal will default to the hostname
   -  [2.4] Capture attributes about the machine

      -  [2.4.1] Hostname
      -  [2.4.2] IP address
      -  [2.4.3] Identify operating system on the machine
      -  [2.4.6] in the case of administrator enrollment, the ID of the
         admin

-  [3] Enable grouping of machines
-  [4] Name change and migration scenarios. Provide a tool to

   -  [4.1]Change the machine/vm hostname
   -  [4.2]Change the machine kerberos principal name when a virtual
      machine is copied or migrated

-  [5] Renewal

   -  [5.1] Automatically renew kerberos principal and service
      principals (Is this needed)
   -  [5.2] Automatically renew certificates before expiration ---
      (Question of how applications behave when this happens)

-  [6] Allow a machine to leave the realm, removing the identity from
   IPA and destroying/revoking any certificates / keytabs.

   -  The task of removing a machine from a realm should not require
      access (physical or networked) to that client machine

.. _service_identity:

Service Identity
----------------

-  [7] Upon join, issue kerberos keytab and/or service certs to services
   and applications. Policy shall determine how services are specified:

   -  [7.1] Services can be specified by tools on the client machine.
      Credentials will be immediately generated and stored in the
      specified location
   -  [7.2] Services can be specified with the GUI on the IPA server.
      Administrators will specify the service and define the location
      where the credentials shall be stored. The IPA client will at some
      future point download those service credential and store them in
      the appropriate location

-  [8] Enable grouping of services and applications
-  [9] Machine kerberos principals should not be used for services by
   default

   -  [9.1] One exception to this will be sshd which will the Machine
      kerberos principal

-  [10] Service principals and/or service certs should be easily
   generatable and useable
-  [11] Option to automatically create service principal and/or certs
   when a new service is setup (later than join)
-  [12] Should be easy to give the same service principal to multiple
   services on different machines (cluster use case)

.. _certificate_authority_integration:

Certificate Authority Integration
---------------------------------

-  [13] Include a certificate authority as part of default server
   install and config

   -  [13.1] No other Certificate system components will be included in
      this release
   -  [13.2] No key escrow DRM
   -  [13.3] No token mangement or token key smartcard components
   -  [13.4] No OCSP responder

-  [14] Utilize certificate authority to gain service certs for each IPA
   server (for LDAP sevice and Web service only)
-  [15] Certificate Authority will be used to issue the machine and
   service specific certs
-  [16] In this version, there will only be support for machine and
   service certificates. There will be no support for user certificates
   for authentiation, signing, encryption
-  [17] It should be possible to store Certificates and key material in
   either flat files or an NSS database

.. _plugin_architecture_framework:

Plugin Architecture / Framework
-------------------------------

-  [18]IPA should be built with a plugin framework that supports the
   addition of multiple different plugin modules

   -  [18.1] Possible plugins could be freeRADIUS, Samba, Certificate
      system for user authentication

-  [19] Plug-ins should be able to provide schema that is picked up by
   the GUI

   -  [19.1] Existing entries should be dynamically updated with default
      values where required by the new Schema

-  [20] Plug-ins should be able to be installed into IPA easily

   -  [20.1] No restart of the core IPA Directory and Authentication
      services should be required
   -  [20.2] The GUI may be restarted to reflect new plugin UI elements

-  [21] Plug-ins should be able to extended the XML-RPC api

   -  [21.1] Plug-ins can it split into discrete elements
   -  [21.2] Schema / UI / Services

-  [22] It should be possible to deploy these elements in an asymetric
   fashion on different IPA servers

   -  [22.1] For example, a plugin's schema is deployed on all IPA
      replica instances but the UI and Service will only run on a single
      IPA sever

.. _schema_cleanup:

Schema cleanup
--------------

-  [23] Rework IPA schema

   -  [23.1]Make it easy to extend for plug-ins
   -  [23.2] Create new schema to support Machine and Service identity
   -  [23.3] Identity schema should be updated to allow better standard
      Kerberos definitions
   -  [23.4] Identity schema should be updated to allow better
      integration with Active Directory

.. _kerberos_referals:

Kerberos Referals
-----------------

-  [24] Support Kerberos referals in DS and IPA
-  [25]Allow Kerberos principals to be know by multiple aliases

   -  [25.1] For example, clients do not have to know a mail or
      webservers fully qualified domain name in order to authenticate an
      alias or shortname should be sufficient

.. _ipa_client:

IPA client
----------

-  [26] IPA shall provide client tools that shall initially set, update,
   and manage the following

   -  [26.1] Update client Kerberos configuration files
   -  [26.2] Update client Directory Server configuration files
   -  [26.3] Update client Authentication files for system login and
      sshd
   -  [26.4] Update client NTP config
   -  [26.5] If the IPA server has been configured as a DNS server the
      client config tool should configure the appropriate DNS
      configuration on the client.

-  [27] A user shall be able to perform the following from an updated
   serverauthconfig

   -  [27.1] Run a client configuration tool
   -  [27.2] Click on IPA Centralized Management
   -  [27.3] Service discovery is attempted
   -  [27.4] Success: ask user if they would like to use discovered
      realm. Client will be configured to authenticate against realm
      using dns service discovery.
   -  [27.5] Failure: prompt for the host name / ip of auth server.
      Client will be configured to authenticate against the ream using
      only the provided host (no service discovery).
   -  [27.6] Optionally the user can visit the Administration UI on the
      IPA server and have it generate sample configuration files (e.g.
      httpd.conf) or have it configure the browser to work with that
      Kerberos Realm

-  [28] IPA client shall include the following additional client
   functionality

   -  [28.1] Implement a local cache to enable user authentication (and
      eventually authorization) when offline
   -  [28.2] Apply policy on these local credentials. e.g. after 90 days
      system must be reconnected to renew policy
   -  [28.3] On reconnect the data is re-synced (and possibly revoked if
      required)
   -  [28.4] Know whether the connection to IPA is up or down
   -  [28.5] Proxy requests from other services to the IPA server and
      back
   -  [28.6] Locally apply the following setting if they have been
      modified on the IPA server

      -  [28.6.1] Service and Machine credentials (keytabs and
         certificates)
      -  [28.6.2] System configuration information (krb, ldap, ntp, dns)

.. _additional_kerberos_configuration_in_ldap:

Additional Kerberos Configuration In LDAP
-----------------------------------------

-  [29] Currently much of the Kerberos Service configuration information
   is stored in files on the local file system. This makes replication
   problematic. Kerberos config should be stored in the Directory so it
   can be replicated throughout the IPA infrastructure

.. _security_of_system:

Security of System
------------------

-  [30] To modify data in IPA, user/process needs to be authenticated
   and authorized
-  [31] Secure the communication between central management store and
   machines
