Highlights
----------

During the past few months a number of security Issues have been found
that affect FreeIPA.

Three Security Advisories have been released:

-  `CVE-2012-4546 <CVE-2012-4546>`__: Incorrect CRLs publishing
-  `CVE-2012-5484 <CVE-2012-5484>`__: MITM Attack during Join process
-  `CVE-2013-0199 <CVE-2013-0199>`__: Cross-Realm Trust key leak

The FreeIPA Team would like to thank the Red Hat Security Response Team
and in particular Vincent Danen for the invaluable assistance provided
for the assessment and resolution of these issues. For CVE-2012-5484 we
would like to thank Petr Menšík for reporting the issue.

Upgrading
---------

Please consult each CVE announcement for related Upgrading instructions.

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 is supported. Upgrading from previous versions is
not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys. Feedback
