Highlights in 3.3.2
-------------------

Enhancements

-  Multiple domains from a trusted Active Directory forest supported now
-  Issue warnings when installed FreeIPA realm differs from the main
   domain as this setup prevents configuring AD trusts
-  Allow PKCS#12 files with empty password in install tools

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  ipa-replica-manage no longer returns RUV error when removing a
   replica
-  ipa-replica-install no longer crashes when being run against a master
   with older Directory Server
-  When creating AD trust, report supported enctypes based on Kerberos
   realm configuration
-  ... and numerous other small fixes

.. _test_improvements:

Test improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  New tests for forced client re-enrollment feature
-  Integration tests no longer require python-paramiko and can run on
   top of bare SSH connection

Supporting Multiple Domains from Trusted Active Directory Forest
----------------------------------------------------------------

Previously only a root level domain of a trusted AD forest was
supported. Now all domains of the trusted AD forest can access resources
in a FreeIPA domain. Free IPA admins are now able to refresh list of
domains from a trusted AD forest and selectively enable and disable
specific domains from accessing resources in FreeIPA domain.

Following commands were added to FreeIPA CLI:

-  ``ipa trust-fetch-domains``

   -  Refresh list of domains from a trusted AD forest. By default all
      found domains belonging to the forest will be allowed to access
      IPA resources.

-  ``ipa trustdomain-find``\ ``[domain]``

   -  List domains of the trusted AD forest, displaying their
      attributes. When *domain* is specified in addition to the trust
      name, only information about *domain* is shown.

-  ``ipa trustdomain-disable``\ ````

   -  Disable access from of the to IPA resources.

-  ``ipa trustdomain-enable``\ ````

   -  Enable access from of the to IPA resources.

-  ``ipa trustdomain-del``\ ````

   -  Remove information about of the from IPA view about the trusted AD
      forest. Users from will not be able to access IPA resources.

Following IPA commands were extended:

-  ``ipa trust-add``

   -  When trust to an AD forest is established, list of domains of the
      forest will be fetched and identity ranges for them will be
      created automatically. In case of POSIX attributes being managed
      by the AD forest, a single identity range for the trusted forest's
      root level domain will be re-used.
   -  When trust to an AD forest is established, list of domains
      associated with IPA is provided to the DC of the forest root level
      domain. This information is used to enable name suffix routing for
      systems belonging to IPA domain. As result, if IPA master servers
      don't belong to IPA DNS domain namespace, they will be able to
      access resources in the trusted AD forest.

FreeIPA 3.3.2 requires use of SSSD 1.11.1 due to integration of non-root
level forest domains support.

Upgrading
---------

.. _freeipa_servers_with_ca_installed_prior_to_version_3.1:

FreeIPA servers with CA installed prior to version 3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manual upgrade procedure is required for FreeIPA servers installed with
version prior to 3.1. Please see
http://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/Dogtag9ToDogtag10Migration for
details.

.. _other_freeipa_servers_and_clients:

Other FreeIPA servers and clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

#. ipa-upgradeconfig
#. ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
