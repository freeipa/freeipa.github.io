The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v3.3.4!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Fedora
19 and Fedora 20 builds are already on their way to updates-testing
repo.



Highlights in 3.3.4
-------------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  New Web UI for trusted domain subdomain management
-  trustdomain-find now shows status (enabled/disabled) of trusted
   domain subdomains
-  group-show command now shows external user's name instead of raw SID
-  FreeIPA is now built with hardening enabled (PIE, RELRO)
-  Added support for kernel keyring CCACHEs



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  ipa-server-install no longer crashes when freeipa-server-trust-ad
   package is not installed on the system
-  ipa-replica-manage no longer crashes when winsync agreement is being
   created
-  CLDAP plugin now correctly handles long hostnames and does not create
   invalid NetBIOS name
-  FreeIPA now builds on PPC and s390 platforms
-  PKI subsystem certificate renewal no longer crash on FreeIPA replicas
-  hbac-test command works for external users again
-  sudoOrder attribute is now present in ou=sudoers LDAP tree
-  trust-fetch-domains command now creates ID ranges for child domains
-  Trust can be now re-established even when it contains subdomains
-  Default Kerberos password policy reference (krbpwdpolicyreference) is
   no longer added to new user's entry. The default policy is now rather
   hard coded in the Kerberos backend to achieve the same behavior for
   both standard FreeIPA users and winsync users
-  dnsrecord-mod no longer produces API version warning
-  ... and numerous other small fixes



Test improvements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Support external names for hosts
-  Various small fixes related to legacy client feature testing



Interface changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  trust-resolve command was hidden from CLI as internal, given that
   group-show command now shows external user's name instead of raw SID

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

#. ipa-upgradeconfig
#. ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
