Tasks
~~~~~

-  Publish presentations
-  Merge `Documentation <Documentation>`__ with
   `DocumentationPortal <DocumentationPortal>`__
-  Show last modification date on each page. This would clearly indicate
   if some content is clearly outdated(2-3+ years).
-  Edit search to not go through pages from Obsolete category, or remove
   the pages from this category. First 10 results for "Samba" are
   Obsolete pages.
-  Point `Trac wiki
   howto <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/wiki/QuickStartGuide>`__ to
   the right location or the guide
-  Clearly define what documentation is where - which is in the user
   guide and which stays on the wiki, we want to avoid duplication.
   Proposal for wiki content:

   -  Designs, proposals
   -  Howtos that we either have not put into the docs or have not
      confirmed ourselves.
   -  If there is a howto that is converted into a user guide chapter it
      should be marked as such on the wiki and had a pointer to the
      guide.

-  `Frequently_Asked_Questions <Frequently_Asked_Questions>`__ (July
   2009) - does not contain useful FAQ for FreeIPA (solving common
   problems during installation, etc.). Rather contains product-related
   FAQ, and quite obsolete anyway. This needs to be updated&renamed or
