Reporting bugs or Features

Security Bugs and Flaws
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Please inform us about all security-related bugs and flaws before you
   make the information public. It will give us chance to release a
   fixed version before the bug will be widely exploited.
-  Please send all relevant information to `Red Hat Product Security
   Team <https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact/>`__.
-  FreeIPA team would like to thank Red Hat Product Security Team for
   their hard work!

Tracking
^^^^^^^^

-  We use `Pagure <https://pagure.io/freeipa/issues>`__ for the upstream
   development, so all RFEs or bug reports should go primarily there.
-  Bugs against released Fedora versions can be logged using the
   following `Bugzilla
   link <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&component=freeipa>`__
   (already set to use *freeipa* as a component)
-  Bugs against released Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions of Identity
   Management product can be logged using the following Bugzilla
   `Bugzilla
   link <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux%208&component=ipa>`__
