Latest Release FreeIPA 1.2.2
----------------------------

Version 1.2.2 is a bugfix release.

Main corrections:

-  Fix group deletion in the web UI.
-  Make the web UI work when both python-cherrypy and python-cherrypy2
   are installed.
-  Fix some Python 2.6 deprecation warnings
-  Change method used to determine CAs to trust.
-  Add the CA constraint to the self-signed CA FreeIPA generates.

NOTE: after an upgrade always run ipa-ldap-updater as root (needs to be
run on each server you upgrade) to make sure all needed directory
changes are uploaded as well. This command requires the Directory
Manager password. The command is automatically run when you install a
new master/replica.

Downloads
---------

Installation instructions are covered in the Installation and Deployment
Guide.



Yum Repo
--------

IPA v1 is available in the Fedora 12, 13 and 14 repos. To install simply
run:

``yum install ipa-server``

On machines to be IPA clients replace **ipa-server** with **ipa-client**

There is no need to enable any additional repositories since this
version of FreeIPA was currently accepted into Fedora.



v1 Notes
--------

-  If you are upgrading an existing FreeIPA installation see
   http://freeipa.org/page/NewCA for details on re-issuing the CA so it
   will work with Firefox 3.5+
