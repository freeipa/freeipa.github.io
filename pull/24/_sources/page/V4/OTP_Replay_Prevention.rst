OTP_Replay_Prevention
=====================

On the Local Replay issue, we do not really need to use locks (which
increase contentions on servers), but I think we can simply use a
delete/add operation that removes by specific value in order to update
the HWM/counter. If 2 auth attempts race on updating the HWM/counter,
then one of them will fail the delete as the value has already been
updated by the other thread. Thus we can have local lockless coherency.

In the Replication Counter Race section it is repeated multiple times
that the HOTP counter must be replicated. I do not think that is
inherently necessary. We can avoid constant replication by adopting 2
techniques. Daily or other interval based replication (like when the
counter is incremented by 10) and/or leap of faith authentication on
usurpation, where even if the counter is much in the future compoared to
what is stored loclly we still accpet authentication, a larger window is
used during usurpation to check for counter-skew. This allows
replication to be performed only occasionally (and maybe only to a more
restricted set of designated HOTP master servers).
