Highlights in 4.9.14
--------------------

-  CVE-2023-5455

During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP
end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to
implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a
cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always
have to go through a new authentication attempt.

The overall severity of this issue is marked as MODERATE by Red Hat
Product Security. FreeIPA team would like to thank Egor Uvarov for
discovering and reporting this issue.
