The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA 4.7.4 release!

It is a security update release that includes fixes for two issues:

-  CVE-2019-10195: Don't log passwords embedded in commands in calls
   using batch

A flaw was found in the way that FreeIPA's batch processing API logged
operations. This included passing user passwords in clear text on
FreeIPA masters. Batch processing of commands with passwords as
arguments or options is not performed by default in FreeIPA but is
possible by third-party components. An attacker having access to system
logs on FreeIPA masters could use this flaw to produce log file content
with passwords exposed.

The issue was reported by Jamison Bennett from Cloudera

-  CVE-2019-14867: Make sure to have storage space for tag

A flaw was found in the way the internal function ber_scanf() was used
in some components of the IPA server, which parsed kerberos key data. An
unauthenticated attacker who could trigger parsing of the krb principal
key could cause the IPA server to crash or in some conditions, cause
arbitrary code to be executed on the server hosting the IPA server.

The issue was reported by Todd Lipcon from Cloudera
