FreeIPA server containers
-------------------------

The https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-container effort focuses on
containerization of FreeIPA server. It makes it possible to run all the
processes comprising the server in an isolated way, leaving the host
free to run other software, not clashing with the FreeIPA server, or
using host with operating system for which FreeIPA is not available.

``Dockerfile.*`` recipes with related content are available in the
repository with definitions for Fedora, RHELs, CentOS 7, and CentOS
Stream.

Container images built automatically from the repository are available
on
`Quay.io <https://quay.io/repository/freeipa/freeipa-server?tab=tags>`__
and on `Docker
hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/freeipa/freeipa-server/>`__.

{{ admon/note \| \| Running FreeIPA servers containerized adds a bit of
complexity compared to traditional deployments on hosts. If things seem
to fail, try the same setup outside of containers first, to figure out
if the issue is with FreeIPA in general or whether it is related to the
containerization. We would like to `hear <Contribute#Communication>`__
your feedback or ideas for improvement! }}

Enroll the host to FreeIPA running in the container
---------------------------------------------------

If you have FreeIPA server running in a container, you can enroll the
host machine to the FreeIPA server. You need to configure the IP address
of the FreeIPA server (running in the container). You can configure it
either in ``/etc/hosts`` or put its IP address to ``/etc/resolv.conf``
if you'd like to use FreeIPA's DNS as well.

If you've named your running container with FreeIPA server with
``--name`` option, for example
``docker run --name freeipa-server-container ...``, you can use that
name to retrieve the IP address:

::

   SERVER_IP_ADDRESS=$( docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' freeipa-server-container )

Otherwise you'd have to use the autogenerated container identifier. You
can then add the IP address to ``/etc/hosts``

::

   echo $SERVER_IP_ADDRESS ipa.example.test >> /etc/hosts

or to ``/etc/resolv.conf``

::

   echo nameserver $SERVER_IP_ADDRESS > /etc/resolv.conf

Then

::

   ipa-client-install --server=ipa.example.test ...

should enroll the host to the containerized FreeIPA server.
