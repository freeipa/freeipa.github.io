privacy, we have provided this Statement explaining our information
practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal

that can be used to identify an individual. The FreeIPA project
leverages Fedora Accounting System and complies with its `privacy

aspects of which apply here.

In addition, some of the pages on the FreeIPA wiki contain explicit
attributions to content writers and might expose a person’s full name.
Some pages also link to external resources that contain public
information about contributors, such as personal blogs. This information
is not collected, but rather voluntarily provided.

data attached to Fedora Accounting System accounts might be made public.

details and how to limit exposure of this information.

system provides. The unique login identifier from the FAS system is
mapped to the internal FreeIPA project account ID. Additional
information that might be copied from FAS into the internal database or
entered manually is full name and email address. This data is used for
the content attribution only.
