  <p>The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v4.0.0!</p>
<p>It can be downloaded from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads">http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads</a>. As this
is a major release, we did not add it to any stable Fedora release
(yet), but we want to first give you a chance to test that yourself with
a <a class="reference external" href="https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/pviktori/freeipa/">COPR
repository</a>.</p>

<section id="enhancements">
<h2>Enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#enhancements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support <strong>Kerberos-based OTP authentication</strong> both natively with
tokens managed by FreeIPA server and via Radius proxy (3rd party 2FA
authentication server).
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3371">ticket</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="V4/OTP">design</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Access control</strong> in FreeIPA server was reworked and a concept of
permissions/ACIs managed by FreeIPA plugin was introduced. The
plugins have now a way to control which objects and attributes should
be visible and to whom. The administrators can now change the default
settings and whitelist or blacklist additional attributes or change
the entire visibility of a specific FreeIPA function (users, groups,
SUDO, …) to anonymous, authenticated users or just a group of
privileged users.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3566">ticket</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="V4/Permissions_V2">design</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Web UI adopted <a class="reference external" href="https://www.patternfly.org/">Patternfly</a><strong>open
interface project</strong> to promote design commonality and improved user
experience. Web UI is now responsive and adapts to different screen
sizes like mobile or tablets. Additionally, many usability or minor
Web UI issues were fixed.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3902">ticket</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="V4/PatternFly_Adoption">design</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental <strong>DNSSEC inline-signing support</strong>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4408">ticket</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/wiki/BIND9/Design/DNSSEC">design</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>DNS management plugin now allows <strong>internationalized domain names</strong>.
Administrators can now enter the DNS records in unicode and have the
management plugin do the conversion to IDN encoding (punycode). The
DNS plugin supports the IDNA 2003 standard.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3169">ticket</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>FreeIPA DNS plugin did not distinguish between master and <strong>forward
zones</strong> and both were merged in one type of object. To remove the
inconsistency, DNS plugin now distinguishes between these 2 types and
separate commands were added for managing forward zones.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3210">ticket</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="V4/Forward_zones">design</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Support the <strong>SubjectAltNames certificate extension</strong> in FreeIPA
service certificates. Certificates with SAN names are useful for load
balancing when a node needs to present itself both with its FQDN and
the balanced address.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3977">ticket</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>ipa-client-install now automatically configures <strong>SUDO</strong> support on
client machines, thus making FreeIPA SUDO integration very easy to
use. (<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3358">ticket</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>ipa-getkeytab can now <strong>fetch</strong> an existent Kerberos keytab for a
chosen service. This allows fetching the same keytab on multiple
hosts which is useful in cluster deployments. The operation is
authorized via the allowedToPerform;read_keys attribute, stored on
the target entry, which contains a DN of a user or a group allowed to
get the keys without resetting them.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3859">ticket</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="V4/Keytab_Retrieval">design</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>ipa-client-install now uploads the FreeIPA CA certificate in a
<strong>system-wide certificate store</strong>, thus making it trusted by all
other services on the OS.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3504">ticket</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Add automember-rebuild command allowing to apply all automember rules
to existing objects (users,
hosts).(<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3752">ticket</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="V4/Automember_rebuild_membership">design</a>)</p></li>

<section id="fa-kerberos-authenication">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>2FA Kerberos Authenication<a class="headerlink" href="#fa-kerberos-authenication" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>FreeIPA now provides support for two-factor authentication (2FA) via
Kerberos. FreeIPA can integrate into exising OTP systems by proxying
requests over RADIUS. FreeIPA also provides integrated support for the
open-standard TOTP (RFC 6238) and HOTP (RFC 4226) tokens, including
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a> and FreeOTP
(<a class="reference external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freeotp/id872559395">iOS</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fedorahosted.freeotp">Android</a>).</p>
<p>Administrators can configure individual users for RADIUS proxy or
HOTP/TOTP. In the latter case, once enabled for HOTP/TOTP, users can
provision, manage and synchronize their own tokens via the CLI or UI.
Administrators can also create tokens on behalf of users, with the
option to grant management permissions to the user. If the user does not
have management permissions, the token is read only (except
synchronization).</p>
<p>When dealing with hardware tokens, administrators can bulk-import the
token metadata using the industry standard Portable Symmetric Key
Container XML (RFC 6030) files.</p>
<section id="limitations">
<h3>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>As this is our first release, it comes with some limitations.</p>
<p>HOTP has concerns about scalability in large replication environments
due to the frequent need to replicate the token counter across the
cluster. For this reason, FreeIPA defaults to TOTP tokens.</p>
<p>TOTP has a known issue where tokens can be re-used within a short
window. This is due to lacking high-watermark support. Implementing this
restriction without careful consideration for the impact on replication
could result in similar problems to HOTP (above).</p>
<p>The workflow for changing passwords causes problems with HOTP tokens.
This is most noticable when passwords expire. In the case of the Web UI,
logins will simply fail. As a workaround for this, the password can
simply be changed using the CLI. In the case of SSSD logins, the login
will succeed but the password change will appear to fail while actually
succeeding.</p>
<p>Currently there is no workflow for lost tokens.</p>

</section>
<section id="reworked-control-access">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>Reworked Control Access<a class="headerlink" href="#reworked-control-access" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Permissions can be set to apply to <em>anonymous</em> or <em>all</em> authenticated
users, or use the existing privilege/role system of assigning rights to
specific users. (<a class="reference external" href="V4/Anonymous_and_All_permissions">design</a>)</p>
<p>Previously, all of the directory, except a few security-sensitive
attributes, was readable by anyone that could connect to the directory
server, even anonymous users. Instead, FreeIPA 4.0 uses fine-grained
permissions to grant read access.
(<a class="reference external" href="V4/Managed_Read_permissions">design</a>) This change may render some
information unreadable to unprivileged users. To grant read rights,
create or find a permission that governs read access to the offending
attribute(s), and either add it to an appropriate role, or set its bind
rule to ‘all’ or ‘anonymous’.</p>
<p>FreeIPA’s existing default add/modify/delete permissions were also
reworked. The default permissions have the “System:” name prefix, and do
not allow structural modifications. Administrators of deployments where
default permissions were customized beyond attribute lists and
privilege/role membership should carefully read the <em>Documentation
draft</em> and <em>Upgrade considerations</em> sections of the <a class="reference external" href="V4/Managed_Read_permissions">design
page</a>, and to test before deploying
FreeIPA 4.0 to production.</p>
<p>Permissions in FreeIPA 4.0 are more flexible, allowing arbitrary
combinations of type, subtree and filters.
(<a class="reference external" href="V4/Multivalued_target_filters_in_permissions">design</a>)</p>
<p>Note that permissions that were created or modified on a FreeIPA 4.0
server, including FreeIPA’s default permissions, can <em>not</em> be modified
on older servers. Adding them to privileges is still possible on any
server.</p>

<section id="dns-master-and-forward-zones">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>DNS Master and Forward Zones<a class="headerlink" href="#dns-master-and-forward-zones" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>New command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ipa</span> <span class="pre">dnsforwardzone</span></code> was introduced and <strong>semantics of
``–forwarder`` option for ``ipa dnszone`` command was changed</strong> to
match BIND semantics.</p>
<p>Functionality previously provided by command
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ipa</span> <span class="pre">dnszone-*</span> <span class="pre">--forwarder</span></code> is from FreeIPA 4.0 provided by command
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ipa</span> <span class="pre">dnsforwardzone-*</span> <span class="pre">--forwarder</span></code>.</p>
<p>Sematics of the old command <strong>``ipa dnszone``</strong> now matches BIND
semantics for <strong>master</strong> zone type. I.e. local BIND replies
authoritatively to queries for data in given zone (including
authoritative NXDOMAIN answers for non-existent names) and forwarding
affects only queries made by BIND to answer recursive queries which
cannot be answered locally. I.e. forwarding affects only queries for
names below zone cuts (NS records) of locally served zones. For further
explanation please see:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-users/2006-January/060810.html">https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-users/2006-January/060810.html</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-users/2011-March/083244.html">https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-users/2011-March/083244.html</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The new command <strong>``ipa dnsforwardzone``</strong> offers semantics equivalent
to BIND <strong>forward</strong> zone type. Forward zone does not contain any
authoritative data and forward queries which cannot be answered from
local cache to configured servers.</p>
<p>Forwarding policy is documented in <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/cur/9.9/doc/arm/Bv9ARM.ch06.html#id2583370">section “Forwarding” in BIND 9

<section id="experimental-dnssec-support">
<span id="id6"></span><h2>Experimental DNSSEC Support<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-dnssec-support" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>DNS zones served by FreeIPA can be secured with
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a>.
The signing process is fully automatic but <strong>signing keys have to be
provided by user manually</strong> and all keys need to be copied to all
FreeIPA DNS servers.</p>
<p>On the first FreeIPA server you can generate signing keys with following
commands (please replace “$ZONE” with zone name without trailing period,
e.g. “example.com”):</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd &quot;/var/named/dyndb-ldap/ipa/$ZONE/keys&quot;</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dnssec-keygen -3 -b 2048 -f KSK &quot;$ZONE&quot;</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dnssec-keygen -3 -b 2048 &quot;$ZONE&quot;</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>At this point you need to <strong>securely</strong> copy all files in directory
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/var/named/dyndb-ldap/ipa/$ZONE/keys</span></code> from the first server to all
other FreeIPA DNS servers. On all servers you have to fix filesystem
permissions and inform <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">named</span></code> that keys are in place:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd &quot;/var/named/dyndb-ldap/ipa/$ZONE/keys&quot;</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chown named: *</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod u=rw,go= *</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rndc sign &quot;$ZONE&quot;</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>Now is your zone signed with given keys. As a last step, it is necessary
to add DS records to your parent zone. See <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/cur/9.9/doc/arm/man.dnssec-dsfromkey.html">man
dnssec-dsfromkey</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/cur/9.9/doc/arm/man.dnssec-checkds.html">man
dnssec-checkds</a>
or ask parent zone operator for guidance.</p>
<p>To enable NSEC3 for given zone you have to specify <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5155#section-4">NSEC3PARAM
record</a>. For example:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ipa dnszone-mod &quot;$ZONE&quot; --nsec3param-rec=&quot;1 0 8 1B3140F28A1C&quot;</span></code></p>
<p>For <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/115.pdf">security reasons</a> it is
recommended <strong>not to use</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5155#section-6">NSEC3 opt-out
feature</a>.</p>

<section id="upgrading">
<h1>Upgrading<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre"># ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre"># ipa-upgradeconfig</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.</p>
<p>If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.</p>
<p>Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.</p>
<p>Upgrading from 3.3.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.</p>
<p>An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.</p>
<section id="transformation-master-to-forward-zones">
<span id="id7"></span><h2>Transformation Master to Forward zones<a class="headerlink" href="#transformation-master-to-forward-zones" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Zones with specified forwarders, with policy different than <em>none</em>, are
transformed to forward zones. All master zones data are backed up in
<strong>/var/lib/ipa/backup/dns-forward-zones-backup-%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S.ldif</strong>.</p>
<p>Transformation to forward zones, is executed only once, by one replica
only, and only if ipa version is lower than 4.0.</p>
<p>Since this upgrade, you should use forward zones to forwarding queries.</p>
