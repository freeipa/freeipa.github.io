The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v4.1.0!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The
builds will be available for Fedora 21. Builds for Fedora 20 are
available in the official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/mkosek/freeipa/>`__.

.. _highlights_in_4.1:

Highlights in 4.1
-----------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  New concept of *ID Views* allowing FreeIPA administrator to define or
   override POSIX attributes for users/groups coming from trusted
   domains. Such users then do not need to have POSIX attributes defined
   in the Active Directory to authenticate to FreeIPA clients. It also
   allows to assign particular view to selected hosts or hostgroups,
   thus allowing having a user / group with different POSIX attributes
   on different hosts. Per-host overrides should be used with extreme
   care! (`design
   page <http://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Migrating_existing_environments_to_Trust>`__)
-  New tool ipa-cacert-manage to manually renew or change FreeIPA
   `PKI <PKI>`__ CA certificate (`design
   page <http://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/CA_certificate_renewal>`__)
-  DNSSEC Support
-  OTP authentication plugin now prevents multiple usage of token codes
   on a single FreeIPA server
-  DNS interface now supports adding DNS root zone (".") allowing admin
   to for example centrally override DNS root hints.
-  DNS zone adding interface was simplified - name server and it's IP
   address is no longer required. The list of authoritative name servers
   are read from LDAP
-  Seamless signing of FreeIPA CA us a subCA in Windows Certificate
   Services (`ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4496>`__)
-  New option ``--request-cert`` to optionally request host certificates
   on FreeIPA clients (to ``/etc/ipa/nssdb/``)
-  CLI and Web UI for *retrive keytab* and *create keytab* authorization
   (`design
   page <http://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Keytab_Retrieval_Management>`__)
-  Services can now be assigned as members of RBAC roles
-  ``ipa`` command run with ``-vv`` option now prints JSON request and
   reply exchanged with the FreeIPA server. ``-vvv`` also prints HTTP
   communication.
-  Description attribute is no longer required (e.g. in groups, sudo
   command groups or others) given that it is also not required in
   schema.
-  Packages can be now built and installed on RHEL/CentOS 7.0
-  ipa-replica-prepare now waits for the replica `DNS <DNS>`__ record to
   be available to fix race conditions in automated test environments
-  Port 8443 is now checked before server installation to prevent
   failures in configuring `PKI <PKI>`__ which uses the port

.. _bug_fixes:

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Server installers can now handle hosts with multiple IPv4 or IPv6
   addresses
-  DNS zone interface no longer accepts ``--class`` option as it had no
   effect as FreeIPA `DNS <DNS>`__ only supports *IN* class.
-  ipa-ldap-upgrade restores Directory Server settings when upgrade
   fails
-  SSLv3.0 (`CVE-2014-3566 <CVE-2014-3566>`__) ciphers are now disabled
   on new installations

.. _dnssec_support:

DNSSEC Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeIPA now automates basic key management for `Domain Name System
Security Extensions
(DNSSEC) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions#Overview>`__.
Before you start signing you DNS zones you have to install DNSSEC key
master role to an existing FreeIPA DNS server using command:

``ipa-dns-install --dnssec-master``

It allows you to enable DNSSEC for particular DNS zone using command:

``ipa dnszone-mod ``\ *``zone.name.example.``*\ `` --dnssec=true``

This command will generate new zone keys, distribute keys to all FreeIPA
DNS servers and configure all servers to independently sign the zone.
Please keep in mind that it can take few minutes before all servers sign
the zone.

.. _known_limitations:

Known Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  User has to manually upload `Delegation Signer (DS)
   record <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions#Records>`__
   to parent DNS zone to establish chain of trust.

-  User has to manually confirm that DS record in parent zone was
   published otherwise `Key Signing Key
   (KSK) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions#Key_management>`__
   will not be rotated. This confirmation has to be done on FreeIPA
   server with key master role using following command:

`` sudo -u ods SOFTHSM2_CONF=/etc/ipa/dnssec/softhsm2.conf ods-ksmutil key ds-seen --zone ``\ *``zone.name.example.``*\ `` --keytag ``\ *``12345``*

-  *Keytag* can be obtained from dig output:

`` dig +dnssec ``\ *``zone.name.example.``*\ `` DSKEY``

-  User is not notified about automated key rotation. This does not
   lower stability of the system because of ``ds-seen`` logic mentioned
   above.

-  Key and signing policy cannot be changed using FreeIPA tools.
   Currently it is stored in ``/etc/opendnssec/kasp.xml`` file on DNSSEC
   key master server. Manual changes to ``kasp.xml`` will be lost during
   next FreeIPA upgrade.

-  Only one FreeIPA server can have DNSSEC key master role:

   -  **Please plan carefully, current version does not allow you to
      easily move DNSSEC master role to a different server.**
   -  DNSSEC key management will not work when the key master is not
      running, i.e. DNSSEC keys will not be rotated according to the
      policy and keys for new zones will not be generated.

.. _known_issues:

Known Issues
------------

-  `Directory Server <Directory_Server>`__ may deadlock in some
   situations (tracked in `upstream
   ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4635>`__).
-  SSLv3.0 (`CVE-2014-3566 <CVE-2014-3566>`__) ciphers are not disabled
   on upgrades. See `CVE-2014-3566 <CVE-2014-3566>`__ and referred
   external articles on advise how to deal with this vulnerability.
-  Install option *--zonemgr* causes assertion error (tracked in
   `upstream ticket <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4663>`__).
   Workaround: do not use option *--zonemgr* in installer and change
   zone manager email after installation using WebUI or command
   *dnszone-mod --admin-email="admin@zone.test."*

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

| ``# ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade``
| ``# ipa-upgradeconfig``

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 3.3.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.

mailing list (http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-users) or
