DNS
===

This page contains **DNS** and **DNSSEC** troubleshooting advice. For
other issues, refer to the index at
`Troubleshooting <Troubleshooting>`__.



Getting logs
============

FreeIPA is using BIND as integrated DNS server. If you suspect that
something is wrong with your DNS, inspect logs generated by BIND.

Depending on your distribution and FreeIPA version, the logs can be on
accessed using three different techniques:

-  $ journalctl -u named-pkcs11
-  $ journalctl -u named
-  file /var/named/data/named.run



Reporting bugs
==============

Please follow `instructions published by bind-dyndb-ldap
project <https://docs.pagure.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/BugReporting.html#bug-reporting>`__.



Kerberos does not work
======================

From common experience, a great portion of issues with FreeIPA or the
`Kerberos <Kerberos>`__ authentication is caused by DNS
misconfiguration. When investigating such issue make sure that:

-  Client forward record is OK both on FreeIPA server and the affected
   FreeIPA client:

      ::

         host $IPA_CLIENT_FQDN

-  Server forward and reverse record is OK both on FreeIPA server and
   the affected FreeIPA client:

      ::

         host $IPA_SERVER_FQDN

      ::

         host $IPA_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS

   -  Returned hostname must be a **fully qualified** hostname with a
      **trailing dot**, e.g. ``server.example.com.``

-  Check ``/etc/hosts`` on the client make sure there is not a wrong
   server entry or a server entry where the first name is not fully
   qualified.



named on server does not start
==============================

See article `What to do when named with bind-dyndb-ldap cannot
start <https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/wiki/BIND9/NamedCannotStart>`__



PTR synchronization does not work
=================================

Most common problems are caused by misconfiguration. Please see article
`How PTR record synchronization
works <https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/wiki/BIND9/SyncPTR>`__.



Forward zone does not work
==========================

At first please try following command:

``dig @forwarder forwarding.zone.name. SOA``

If command above returns *NXDOMAIN* or *SERVFAIL*, please check your
forwarder.



DNSSEC validation
-----------------

-  Do you use TLD domains you don't own (like *.local* or *.corp*)?
-  Do you have ``dnssec-validation yes;`` in */etc/named.conf*?
-  Does ``journalctl -u named-pkcs11`` show errors about record
   signatures?

Then DNSSEC validation prevents you from resolving records from the
forward zone.

How to fix it:

-  at first please don't use domains you don't own (`FreeIPA Deployment
   Recommendations <http://www.freeipa.org/page/Deployment_Recommendations#Domain>`__)
-  if you really need those domains, you have to set
   ``dnssec-validation no;`` in */etc/named.conf* on all FreeIPA DNS
   servers (and proceed restart)



missing zone delegation
-----------------------

Do you have a master zone that is the parent of your forward zone (both
on FreeIPA server)? Example:

-  master zone: ipa.freeipa.org.
-  forward zone: others.ipa.freeipa.org.

Please check if master zone contains an *NS delegation record* and *A
glue records* (`HOWTO - Delegate a Sub-domain (a.k.a.
subzone) <http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/delegate.html>`__).

Example:

| ``$ORIGIN ipa.freeipa.org.``
| ``others ``\ **``NS``**\ `` ns.others.ipa.freeipa.org.``
| ``ns.others ``\ **``A``**\ `` 192.0.2.1``
| ``ns.others ``\ **``AAAA``**\ `` 2001:db8::1``

Without zone delegation all queries are processed by master zone and
NXDOMAIN is returned (`Forward zones design
page <http://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Forward_zones#Avoid_an_ineffective_forward_zone>`__).



Forward policy set to *none*
----------------------------

Please check your forward policy:

``ipa dnsforwardzone-show ipa.freeipa.org.``

If forward policy is set to **none**, forwarding is disabled. Please set
**first** or **only** as *forward-policy* to allow forwarding.



DNSSEC signing does not work
============================

Related information how to use DNSSEC with FreeIPA can be found in
`DNSSEC howto <DNSSEC>`__.



DNSSEC signing is not enabled for the particular zone
-----------------------------------------------------

``ipa dnszone-show ipa.example``

::

   Allow in-line DNSSEC signing: TRUE

Use command ``ipa dnszone-mod ipa.example --dnssec=1`` to enable DNSSEC
signing for given zone.



DNSSEC master is not configured
-------------------------------

Verify that one server is configured to be DNSSEC key master. Run
following commands on one FreeIPA replica and check that exactly one
LDAP entry is printed out:

-  ``kinit admin``
-  ``ldapsearch -Y GSSAPI '(&(ipaConfigString=enabledService)(ipaConfigString=dnssecKeyMaster))'``

::

   dn: cn=DNSSEC,cn=vm-236.idm.lab.eng.brq.redhat.com,cn=masters,cn=ipa,cn=etc,dc=ipa,dc=example
   objectClass: ipaConfigObject
   objectClass: nsContainer
   objectClass: top
   ipaConfigString: dnssecKeyMaster
   ipaConfigString: startOrder 100
   ipaConfigString: enabledService
   cn: DNSSEC

   # numEntries: 1

-  If no entry was found, promote one FreeIPA replica to be the DNSSEC
   key master: ``ipa-dns-install --dnssec-master``



DNSSEC key master services are not running
------------------------------------------

Run ``ipactl status`` on the DNSSEC key master and check that all
services are running: All services should be in state ``RUNNING`` except
``ipa-ods-exporter`` service which is run only on-demand.



DNS keys are not generated by OpenDNSSEC
----------------------------------------

Here we begin with root account on the replica in DNSSEC key master
role. First of all switch to user ``ods`` so you do not mangle
filesystem permissions:

-  ``sudo -u ods -s /bin/bash``
-  ``source /etc/sysconfig/ods``
-  ``export SOFTHSM2_CONF``

Now you can list zones managed by OpenDNSSEC:

-  ``ods-enforcer zone list`` (use ``ods-ksmutil`` on RHEL 7)

::

   Found Zone: ipa.example; on policy default

If the zone is not in the list, restart ``ipa-dnskeysyncd`` service
which is responsible for LDAP->OpenDNSSEC synchronization and check its
logs if the restart did not help.

If the zone is in the list, verify that DNSSEC keys were generated for
the zone. You should see:

-  At least one key with type ``KSK`` in state ``publish`` or
   ``active``.
-  At least one key with type ``ZSK`` in state ``active``.

-  ``ods-enforcer key list --verbose`` (use ``ods-ksmutil`` on RHEL 7)

::

   Zone:         Keytype:   State:    Date of next transition (to):  Size:   Algorithm:  CKA_ID:     Repository:   Keytag:
   ipa.example   ZSK        active    2015-06-03 12:52:07 (retire)   2048    8           623d723...  SoftHSM       60195
   ipa.example   KSK        publish   2015-03-06 02:52:07 (ready)    2048    8           60b5ce3...  SoftHSM       6046

Missing keys indicate a problem with OpenDNSSEC or possibly lack of
entropy. Check logs for ``ods-enforcerd`` service.



DNS keys are stored in local HSM on key master replica
------------------------------------------------------

Verify that keys shown by OpenDNSSEC ``key list`` command actually exist
in local HSM on the DNSSEC key master replica:

-  ``sudo -u ods python3 -m ipaserver.dnssec.localhsm`` (replace
   ``python3`` with ``python2`` on RHEL 7)

Every CKA_ID has to be listed in twice with boolean parameters shown
below. Please ignore other values printed by ``localhsm`` command.

::

   zone public keys
   ================
   623d723...
   {'ipk11label': u'623d723...', 'ipk11verify': True, ...}
   ...

   zone private keys
   =================
   623d723...
   {'ipk11label': u'623d723...', 'ipk11sign': True, 'ipk11extractable': True, ...}
