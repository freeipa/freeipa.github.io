IPAv3_300_rc2
=============

The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version FreeIPA v3.0.0 rc 2.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads.

Builds are not yet available but we plan builds for Fedora 18 and
rawhide. The tarball is available on the Downloads page.

For additional information see the AD Trust design page
http://freeipa.org/page/IPAv3_AD_trust and the AD Trust testing page
http://freeipa.org/page/IPAv3_testing_AD_trust.



Highlights since 3.0.0 rc 1
---------------------------

-  Python changes to work with python-ldap 2.3.
-  Add missing indices for automount and principal aliases which will
   improve performance.
-  Provide a new Firefox extension for configuring the browser. Firefox
   15 deprecated the interface we used in the past to set the Kerberos
   negotiation directives. This new extension will be used on Firefox 15
   and beyond, and the older interface for older browsers.
-  Man page improvements
-  A SID can be created as the last step of ipa-adtrust-install.
-  Create a default fallback group for AD trust users.

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 should work but has not been fully tested. Proceed
with caution.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
