Writing_how_to_documentation_on_the_wiki
========================================

Writing a how to page on the wiki is straightforward.



Get an account with permission to edit wiki
-------------------------------------------

Please see page
`Contribute#Contribute_documentation <Contribute#Contribute_documentation>`__.



Create a page name that describes the content and is a natural language phrase
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, the name of this page is `HowTo/Writing how to
documentation on the
wiki <HowTo/Writing_how_to_documentation_on_the_wiki>`__. (Please create
new How To pages using the prefix HowTo/)

More information on page names is at `Help:Wiki
structure <Help:Wiki_structure>`__.



Put your how-to content in to the page
--------------------------------------

Try to be clear with your writing, it will help the wiki writers and
editors who help improve your article/page.

Don't be afraid to read and understand the
`Help:Editing <Help:Editing>`__ page.

Don't forget the next step, it helps your content be found by wiki
editors and readers.



You can put an optional DRAFT header to warn readers
----------------------------------------------------

Put this template call at the top of your page:

{{Draft}}

This also helps wiki contributors find your page as linked to the draft
template.



Add your page to at least two specific categories and any other relevant ones
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of your content, put these two categories, each on its own
line:

[[Category:How to]] [[Category:Draft documentation]]

The first puts your content in the `:Category:How
to <:Category:How_to>`__ for readers to find. The second puts your page
in the `:Category:Draft documentation <:Category:Draft_documentation>`__
for wiki contributors to find and help improve.

Once you are happy with the contents and the Howto has been reviewed by
someone on freeipa-devel then please add a link to the `main HowTo
Page <HowTos>`__

Profit!

Now you have a how-to page that you can reference, it will gain
improvements from wiki collaboration, and you have added to the
collective knowledge on the canonical FreeIPA wiki.
