The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA 4.7.3 release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Builds
for Fedora 29 will be available in the official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/freeipa/freeipa-4-7/>`__.



Highlights in 4.7.3
-------------------

-  6077: [RFE] Support One-Way Trust authenticated by trust secret

With this enhancement, Identity Management (IdM) supports establishing a
one-way forest trust to Active Directory (AD) authenticated by a shared
secret from the Windows AD domain controller (DC). Previous IdM versions
did not contain the features that allowed AD DCs to contact an IdM DC in
the mentioned scenario. As a result, IdM now supports establishing a
one-way forest trust using a shared secret from both Active Directory
and from IdM.

--------------

-  7193: [RFE] Warn or adjust umask if it is too restrictive to break
   installation

If the umask has been used during the installation of an Identity
Management (IdM) it was "too restrictive" This RFE checks for
too-restrictive mask at install time and error out when this happens to
avoid not working deployments of the FreeIPA server.

--------------

-  7206: [RFE] Provide an option to include FQDN in IDM topology graph

IdM WebUI is now able to display the fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
of the nodes in its Topology Graph. As a result, the topology graph is
able to distinguish nodes with the same short hostname but within
different domains.

--------------

-  7716: [RFE] remove "last init status" from ipa-replica-manage list if
   it's None.

In verbose mode, the command ipa-replica-manage list displays additional
details such as the status and timestamp of the last initialization or
the last update. When no initialization occurred on the server, the
command doesn't display any more the labels 'last init status: None' and
'last init ended: 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00:00' which were confusing.

--------------

-  7747: [RFE] Support interactive prompt for NTP options for FreeIPA

With patches related to this RFE an Identity Management (IdM) is no
longer unable to set time servers/pool when run without NTP related
options passed only by command line options. This prompt for NTP server
and pool options applies to interactive installations run without
--unattended/-U option aiming to improve user experience for users not
familiar with command line options.
