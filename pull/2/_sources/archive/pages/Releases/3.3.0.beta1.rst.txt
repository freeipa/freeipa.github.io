The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v3.3.0 Beta 1.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. As this
is a Beta release, there is no public Fedora build at this time but we
will prepare Fedora 19 builds for `FreeIPA 3.3 Test
Day <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-07-25_AD_trusts_with_POSIX_attributes_in_AD_and_support_for_old_clients>`__.

**Important**: please see section *Upgrading* before upgrading the
packages, a manual procedure is needed for FreeIPA servers with CA
originally installed with FreeIPA version prior to 3.1.

Highlights in 3.3 beta 1
------------------------

.. _new_features_for_3.3:

New features for 3.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Active Directory integration:

   -  Support of externally defined POSIX attributes for Active
      Directory trusted domains
   -  Automatic discovery of Active Directory identity mapping
      configuration
   -  Support of trusted domain users for legacy clients
   -  Identity mapping for AD users can now be delegated

-  Performance improvements in processing large number of users and
   groups
-  Automated integration testing infrastructure
-  ipa-advise utility is added to generate client setup advice based on
   an IPA master configuration
-  FreeIPA-specific SELinux policies has been merged to the main SELinux
   policy in Fedora 19
-  SSSD 1.11 is required

.. _active_directory_integration:

Active Directory integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with FreeIPA 3.3, it is possible to define identity ranges for
a trusted Active Directory domain that rely on POSIX attributes provided
by AD DC instead of generating them out of corresponding security
identifiers. This functionality requires Services for Unix (SFU) or
Identity Management for UNIX enabled on Active Directory side and is
provided mostly to aid with migration to SID-based mapping.

In order to support externally defined POSIX attributes, identity ranges
have been extended to support new range types:

-  AD trust with SID-based mapping: 'ipa-ad-trust' (default)
-  SFU support: 'ipa-ad-trust-posix'

'ipa-ad-trust-posix' range type is activated when range discovery finds
out SFU is in use by Active Directory domain. To override automatic
detection, --range-type=ipa-ad-trust can be specified to 'ipa trust-add'
command.

FreeIPA 3.3 requires SSSD 1.11 on the IPA master in order to support
externally defined POSIX attributes in AD.

More details:
http://www.freeipa.org/page/V3/Use_posix_attributes_defined_in_AD

FreeIPA 3.3 provides a new way to enable legacy clients to support
trusted domain users. A compatibility tree, provided by slapi-nis, can
now be configured to look up trusted domain users and handle
authentication for them. This functionality relies on SSSD 1.11 and an
experimental patch for slapi-nis. One can enable legacy clients support
by running ipa-adtrust-install and answering positively to the
corresponding question.

More details:
http://www.freeipa.org/page/V3/Serving_legacy_clients_for_trusts

Finally, SSSD 1.11 is used to query identity information about trusted
domains' users from within IPA framework, including SID to name and name
to SID resolution. In addition to speed improvements, FreeIPA 3.3 allows
to manage mappings for trusted domains' users without requiring elevated
privileges of 'trust admins'.

.. _performance_improvements:

Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When acting on large datasets, FreeIPA now reduces number of potential
read roundtrips required to update user and group information. When
scaled to thousands of users and groups, this shortens the time required
by certain operations tenfold.

.. _automated_testing_infrastructure:

Automated testing infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FreeIPA team has been providing self-testing code for a long time.

The FreeIPA 3.3 test suite includes a framework for integration tests
that verify functionality such as replication across several machines.
Tests can be run manually, or by test automation servers such as Jenkins
or Beaker.

Development builds now create a freeipa-tests RPM containing the test
suite and related tools. However, as the focus is on testing development
code, this package will not be released to Fedora yet.

More details: http://www.freeipa.org/page/V3/Integration_testing

Additionally, it is now possible to run Web UI tests through the test
suite.

More details: http://www.freeipa.org/page/Web_UI_Integration_Tests

.. _ipa_advise_tool:

IPA advise tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeIPA 3.3 introduces new framework to generate recipes of
configuration based on how IPA master is configured. These recipes can
be taken to the target client systems and used there to configure them
for a specific task.

We expect to expand use of 'ipa-advise' tool to cover at least
configuration of legacy systems in subsequent releases. Contributions
are always welcome to grow capabilities of 'ipa-advise' tool to other
areas.

More details:
http://www.freeipa.org/page/V3/Serving_legacy_clients_for_trusts#Major_configuration_options_and_enablement

.. _selinux_policy:

SELinux policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SELinux policies specific to FreeIPA have been merged back to the main
SELinux policy package in Fedora 19. Starting with FreeIPA 3.2.2
(available in Fedora 19 updates) SELinux policy is no londer provided by
freeipa-selinux package and the package is removed in favor of
selinux-policy package.

.. _sssd_1.11_is_required:

SSSD 1.11 is required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeIPA 3.3 depends on SSSD 1.11 for cross-realm trusts with Active
Directory. In particular, FreeIPA 3.3 depends on a new operational mode
of SSSD called 'ipa_server_mode'. Thus, SSSD 1.11 is required for
FreeIPA 3.3.

Upgrading
---------

.. _freeipa_servers_with_ca_installed_prior_to_version_3.1:

FreeIPA servers with CA installed prior to version 3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Manual upgrade procedure <Howto/Dogtag9ToDogtag10Migration>`__ is
required for FreeIPA servers installed with version prior to
`3.1 <IPAv3_310>`__.

.. _other_freeipa_servers_and_clients:

Other FreeIPA servers and clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note, that the performance improvements requires an extended set
of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a
excessive number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.

Feedback
--------

Please provide comments, bugs and other feedback via the freeipa-users
mailing list (http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/freeipa-users) or
#freeipa channel on Freenode.
