The FreeIPA team is proud to announce version FreeIPA v3.1.4.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. The new
version has also been built for Fedora 18 and is on its way to
updates-testing:

Highlights in 3.1.4
-------------------



New features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Added support for new Dogtag 10.0.2
-  Added support for new OpenSSH 6.2
-  Added userClass attribute for hosts entries
-  Server/replica installation now accepts --mkhomedir option



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  New certificates issued by FreeIPA CA now contain correct OCSP/CRL
   URIs [1]
-  /etc/ipa directory ownership was fixed
-  Deprecated HBAC Source host related options were removed from CLI

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Due to changes related to OCSP/CRL URI fix [1], ipa-ca.DOMAIN DNS name
is automatically converted from a set of CNAMEs to a set of A/AAAA
records pointing to FreeIPA servers with CA configured.

Please note, that the referential integrity extension requires an
extended set of indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server
with a excessive number of hosts, SUDO or HBAC entries may require
several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 is supported. Upgrading from previous versions is
not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
