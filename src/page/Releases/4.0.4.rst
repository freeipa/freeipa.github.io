The FreeIPA team would like to announce FreeIPA v4.0.4 bugfix release!

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Builds
for Fedora 21 are available in the official `COPR
repository <https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/mkosek/freeipa-4.0/>`__.



Highlights in 4.0.4
-------------------

Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Packages can be now built and installed on RHEL/CentOS 7.0
-  ipa-replica-prepare now waits for the replica `DNS <DNS>`__ record to
   be available to fix race conditions in automated test environments
-  Port 8443 is now checked before server installation to prevent
   failures in configuring `PKI <PKI>`__ which uses the port



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Certmonger CAs are now set with correct path to ipa-submit which
   caused problems with new certificate submission
-  `Directory Server <Directory_Server>`__ again returns basic RootDSE
   attributes by default - namingContexts, supportedControl,
   supportedExtension, supportedLDAPVersion, supportedSASLMechanisms,
   vendorName, vendorVersion
-  "IPA OTP Last Token" plugin is now enabled also on upgraded FreeIPA
   servers before 4.0.0
-  Better error message is provided if cert-request command fails for
   certificates with SAN
-  `CA <PKI>`__ certificate renewal script (ca_renewal_master) triggered
   by `certmonger <certmonger>`__ could fail
-  sudorule-add-runasuser command now works with external users
-  "IPA" CA is now properly selected for Web Service and Directory
   Service certificates

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

::

    # ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade
    # ipa-upgradeconfig

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 3.3.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
