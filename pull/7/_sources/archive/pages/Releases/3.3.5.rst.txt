Highlights in 3.3.5
-------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  DNS classless support for reverse domains

.. _bug_fixes:

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Lockout plugin was not applied to users with default password policy
-  Migration plugin did not add users to default group (ipausers)
-  AD Trust subdomains were not automatically fetched by trust-add
   command
-  When installing Dogtag 10 replica with a CA from a Dogtag 9 based
   replica, the ipa-replica-conncheck did not check if Dogtag 9 DS port
   is open
-  When installing Dogtag 10 replica with a CA from a Dogtag 9 based
   replica, CA database was not updated resulting in limited
   functionality of the CA
-  Trust could not be added with --shared-secret option
-  Active AD Trust subdomain ID range could be deleted
-  FreeIPA client returned invalid group membership info when multiple
   AD Trusts were configured
-  /ca/ee/ca/profileSubmit proxy URI was added to allow cloning of PKI
   10.1.1 and newer
-  ... and numerous other small fixes

Test improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Many fixes related to Active Directory integration tests

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

#. ipa-upgradeconfig
#. ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
