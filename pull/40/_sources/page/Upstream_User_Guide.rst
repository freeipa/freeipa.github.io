Upstream_User_Guide
===================

Currently, FreeIPA project does not actively maintain any upstream guide
in a form of a book. The upstream authoritative source of information is
the this wiki site. Please see
`Documentation <Documentation#User_Documentation>`__ page for the list
of the most recent user documentation and links to books written by
others.

History
-------

Until 2013, FreeIPA project had a Technical Writer maintaining both RHEL
downstream guide and `upstream FreeIPA
guide <http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html-single/FreeIPA_Guide/index.html>`__
built for `Fedora project <http://docs.fedoraproject.org/>`__. When the
Technical Writer got out of capacity to handle the upstream guide, the
FreeIPA development team
`announced <https://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-users/2013-August/msg00044.html>`__
an effort to carry the torch and forked the outdated documentation in a
new `repository <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/freeipa-docs.git>`__
and started the work on reviving it again (`Trac milestone
1 <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/milestone/Revive%20FreeIPA%20guide>`__,
`Trac milestone
2 <https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/milestone/FreeIPA%203.x%20Documentation>`__).

Unfortunately, over it became apparent that despite several brave
contributors helping with the guide, the project simply does not have
resources to develop both FreeIPA and comprehensive documentation for
it. The FreeIPA guide was way behind the RHEL downstream guides
maintained by a new Technical Writer. In addition, old Fedora released
documentation often popped up and clobbered FreeIPA upstream
documentation in search engine results. The situation required change
that FreeIPA users are not confused with obsolete information.

Writing documentation is enormous task in itself. However, until a team
of upstream Technical Writers joins the project to contribute alongside
the developers (`call for help on freeipa-users
list <https://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-users/2014-September/msg00357.html>`__)
the only viable option is to stop maintaining and reviving the upstream
guide and keep only 2 main sources of documentation - design documents
and articles of this community wiki, and downstream documentation, from
which the RHEL one is the most complete. Guide was orphaned, as
`announced <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/docs/2014-October/015878.html>`__
on fedora-docs list.
