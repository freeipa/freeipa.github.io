http://freeipa.org/page/IPAv3_AD_trust and the AD Trust testing page
http://freeipa.org/page/IPAv3_testing_AD_trust.



Highlights since 3.0.0 beta 1
-----------------------------

-  NTLM password hash is generated for existing users on first use of
   IPA cross-realm environment based on their Kerberos keys without
   requiring a password change.
-  Secure identifiers compatible with Active Directory are generated
   automatically for existing users upon set up of IPA cross-realm
   environment.
-  Use certmonger to renew CA subsystem certificates
-  Support for DNS zone transfers to non-IPA slaves
-  Internal change to LDAP Distinguished Name handling to be more robust
-  Better support for Internet Explorer 9 in the UI
-  Allow multiple servers on client install command-line and configuring
   without DNS discovery.
-  Translation updates

Upgrading
---------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 should work but has not been fully tested. Proceed
with caution.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys (using host-mod).
