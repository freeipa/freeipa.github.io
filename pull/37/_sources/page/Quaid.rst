Quaid
=====

I am a community gardener for Red Hat, which means I help dig, feed,
design, water, prune, and otherwise help grow open communities. In
particular I have worked across multiple parts of the `Fedora
Project <http://fedoraproject.org>`__ learning, distilling, and
implementing `community
architecture <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Community_Architecture>`__
ideas.

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Quaid is canonical.

This page/namespace is being used for a writing sandbox to check
content, ideas, etc. before moving them across the rest of the wiki.



What's in the sandbox
---------------------

-  `User:Quaid/Community_action_ideas <User:Quaid/Community_action_ideas>`__



Tasks worked for FreeIPA community
----------------------------------

-  Wiki organization

   -  Help pages
   -  Style, page naming guidelines

-  Coordinate potential move of wiki to Fedora Hosted for ease of
   contribution management of users?

   -  Alternately, resolve wiki enough so that native self-account
      creation is good enough
