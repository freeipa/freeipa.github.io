The FreeIPA team is proud to announce FreeIPA v3.3.1!

This is a bugfix release.

It can be downloaded from http://www.freeipa.org/page/Downloads. Fedora
19 builds are already on their way to updates-testing repo.



Highlights in 3.3.1
-------------------



Bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  ipa-server-certinstall now works correctly both with a CA subsystem
   and in CA-less installations
-  The --subject option in ipa-server-install is now handled correctly
-  During installation, directory server tuning is performed correctly
   on sysV and systemd systems
-  During installation, the CA service is stopped during configuration
   file changes to prevent race conditions



Test improvements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Integration tests for CA-less installation, Kerberos flags, and
   related Web UI parts were added to the test suite
-  Test suite now passes after ipa-adtrust-install

Upgrading
---------



FreeIPA servers with CA installed prior to version 3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manual upgrade procedure is required for FreeIPA servers installed with
version prior to 3.1. Please see
http://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/Dogtag9ToDogtag10Migration for
details.



Other FreeIPA servers and clients
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An IPA server can be upgraded simply by installing updated rpms. The
server does not need to be shut down in advance.

Please note that if you are doing the upgrade in special environment
(e.g. FedUp) which does not allow running the LDAP server during upgrade
process, upgrade scripts need to be run manually after the first boot:

#. ipa-upgradeconfig
#. ipa-ldap-updater --upgrade

Also note that the performance improvements require an extended set of
indexes to be configured. RPM update for an IPA server with a excessive
number of users may require several minutes to finish.

If you have multiple servers you may upgrade them one at a time. It is
expected that all servers will be upgraded in a relatively short period
(days or weeks, not months). They should be able to co-exist peacefully
but new features will not be available on old servers and enrolling a
new client against an old server will result in the SSH keys not being
uploaded.

Downgrading a server once upgraded is not supported.

Upgrading from 2.2.0 and later versions is supported. Upgrading from
previous versions is not supported and has not been tested.

An enrolled client does not need the new packages installed unless you
want to re-enroll it. SSH keys for already installed clients are not
uploaded, you will have to re-enroll the client or manually upload the
keys.
